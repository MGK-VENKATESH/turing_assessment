module K1 that satisfies all requirements for Category 3 or 4 and PL e. • The auxiliary contacts of the contactor Q2 are mechanically linked in accordance with IEC 60947-5-1, Annex L. • Faults are analysed for Q2 (with mirror contacts) and for the internal relay of the contactor monitoring module F1 as for mechanically linked contacts. Remark • Consideration must be given to the response time caused by the contactor monitoring module F1 with regard to the dropping-out of Q1. Calculation of the probability of failure • The safety function permits division into two subsystems. The subsystem consisting of the safeguard and the safety module K1 is not considered in this example. • MTTF : for the contactor monitoring module F1, the MTTF is 125 years at a maximum n of 350,400 cycles per D D op year [M]. Under inductive load (AC 3), the B value attained for Q1 is 10,000 switching cycles and the B value 10D 10D attained for Q2 1,300,000 switching cycles. With assumed actuation daily on 365 working days, n is 365 cycles op per year forQ1, and the MTTF is 274 years. At 365 working days, 16 working hours and a cycle time of 1 minute, D n is 350,400 cycles per year for Q2, and the MTTF is 37 years. For the channel consisting of F1 and Q1, this results op D in an MTTF of 85 years. Overall, the resulting symmetrized MTTF value per channel is 64 years (“high”). D D • DC : the DC of 99% for Q2 is based upon testing by means of the contactor monitoring module F1. A DC of 99% for avg F1 is achieved by fault-detection measures within the contactor monitoring module. The circuit-breaker Q1 is tested by means of the manual test function that is to be implemented; this produces a DC of 90%. A DC of 99% is substi- tuted for F1. Averaging thus yields a DC of 98% (“medium”). avg • Adequate measures against common cause failure (65 points): separation (15), overvoltage protection etc. (15) and environmental conditions (25 + 10) • The subsystem, comprising Q1, Q2 and F1, satisfies Category 3 with a high MTTF (64 years) and medium DC D avg (98%). This results in an average probability of dangerous failure of 4.4 · 10-8 per hour. This satisfies PL e. Following addition of the subsystem, comprising safeguard and safety module K1, the PL may under certain circumstances be lower. • In consideration of estimation erring on the safe side as described above, a T value of 3.7 years is produced for 10D the wearing element Q2 for replacement as specified. 211 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS Figure 8.59: Determining of the PL by means of SISTEMA 212 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS 213 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS 8.2.31 Pneumatic valve control (subsystem) – Category 4 – PL e (Example31) Hazardous 1A movement 1S2 G 1V2 G 1S1 1V1 0S1 P 0V1 0Z Figure 8.60 Tested pneumatic valves for redundant control of hazardous movements Safety functions • Safety-related stop function: stopping of the hazardous movement and prevention of unexpected start-up from the rest position, implemented by safety sub-function SDE. • Only the pneumatic part of the control system is shown here, in the form of a subsystem. Further SRP/CS (e.g. safeguards and electrical logic elements) must be added in the form of subsystems for completion of the safety function. 214 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS 1V1 1V2 1S1 1S2 Functional description • A hazardous movement of the cylinder is controlled redundantly by the valves 1V1 and 1V2. The movements can be halted either by the directional control valve 1V1 or 1V2. • Failure of one of these valves alone does not result in loss of the safety function. • Should at least one of the control signals be cancelled, the piston side of the cylinder is vented. • A single valve fault is detected by the integral position monitoring function when the control signal is cancelled; following a fault, initiation of the next hazardous movement is prevented. Design features • Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. • 1V1 and 1V2 are directional control valves with sufficient overlap, spring-return and electrical position monitoring. • Cancellation of the control signals places the valve in the safety-oriented switching position. • Signal processing by the electrical position monitoring function satisfies the relevant requirements for the control of failures. Calculation of the probability of failure • MTTF : a B value of 20,000,000 cycles [M] is assumed for the directional control valves. At 240 working days, D 10D 16 working hours and a cycle timeof 20 seconds, n is 691,200 cycles per year and the MTTF is 289 years (“high”). op D This is also the MTTF value per channel. D • DC : direct monitoring of the switching states yields a DC of 99% for 1V1 and 1V2. The resulting DC is also 99% avg avg (“high”). • Adequate measures against common cause failure (65 points): separation (15), overvoltage protection etc. (15) and environmental conditions (25 + 10) • The combination of the pneumatic control elements satisfies Category 4 with a high MTTF (289 years) and a high D DC (99%). This results in an average probability of dangerous failure of 8.1 · 10-9 per hour. This satisfies PL e. Fol- avg lowing the addition of further SRP/CS in the form of subsystems for completion of the safety function, the PL may under certain circumstances be lower.
