Information for use includes, for example: • Acoustic and optical warning devices • Information and warnings on the machinery • Operating instructions including their warning and safety instructions • Operating procedures, training requirements, or briefing of users • Instructions about the use of personal protective equipment NOTE Information for use shall not be a replacement for other measures! NOTE - Safe design, risk assessment and risk reduction type-A standard: ISO 12100 - Design principles for information for use: EN ISO 20607, EN IEC/IEEE 82079-1 Acoustic and visual warning devices If the operation of a machine is not monitored, warning devices must be provided on the machine to alert the operator to hazards caused by malfunc‐ tions. Warning devices must be clearly and readily understandable. It shall be possible for the operating personnel to check that they are constantly ready for operation. Where residual risks remain, the manufac‐ turer must warn of these.

They shall be drawn up in the official language of the country in which the machine is being put to market. Additional warnings in other languages may be used. Information that is relevant to safety must be formu‐ lated in a way that is clear, easy to understand, suc‐ cinct, and precise. Interactive means of communication must be easy to understand and support intuitive oper‐ ation. Figure 123: Examples of information and warnings on machines Safety-relevant information in the operating instructions The operating instructions must include all safety-relevant information for the machine. The following information, in particular, must be provided: • Safety instructions advising how to safely use the machine, as well as any warnings relevant to a specific action • Description of the intended use, and warnings relating to reasonably foreseeable misuse of the machine • Notes about commissioning and operation of the machine as well as about required training and/or briefing of operating personnel • Information on residual risks, including warnings, that remain despite the measures taken to incorporate safety into the design and application of protective devices and complementary
