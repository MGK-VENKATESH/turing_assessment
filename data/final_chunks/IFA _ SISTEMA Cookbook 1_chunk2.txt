B -value 10d All steps required for creation of a SISTEMA project and for analysis are explained below. The entries relating to documentation have no influence upon the analysis. This aspect will not be considered further. Note: It is advisable to select the order of entries such that the tabs in the working area are worked through from left to right, and the hierarchy levels (tree view in the navigation window) from top to bottom. 4.1 Creating a project All safety functions of a machine or sub-machine can be grouped within a project (Figure 7). After creating a new project with "New" (1.), enter a name in the "Project name" dialog (3.). The name then also appears in the navigation window after the abbreviation PR (2.). 11.. 22.. 33..

The "Name of safety function" also appears in the navigation window, after the abbreviation SF (see Figure 9; 1.). 11.. 22.. 33..

Figure 10 4.5 Encapsulated subsystems Manufacturers' data on the PL, PFH and Category are available for encapsulated systems. Enter them (4.) directly below the subsystem (1.) in the "PL" tab (2.) after selecting "Enter PL / PFH directly" (3.) (Figure 11). The Category can be entered in the next tab, "Category". Since the PL and PFH are available for this subsystem, it is not necessary to enter the Cate- gory for calculation of the PFH of the safety function as a whole. Note: If the box (4.) is checked, the PL and PFH are calculated from each other by means of mean values. Fault exclusion: In encapsulated systems in which all hazardous component faults are excluded, check the "Failure exclusion" box ( PFH=0). 22.. 11.. 33.. 44..

Figure 15 d) For each two-channel subsystem, faults must be considered which would cause both channels to fail for the same reason (CCF). Of these, Category 2 (functional channel and test channel) and Categories 3 and 4 (two functional channels in each case) are affected. Entry is made in the subsystem (1.) under "CCF" (2.) by selection of the measures to be taken (Figure 16). At least 65 points must be reached. The number of points reached can be entered directly or compiled by a library of measures (3. and 4.). 22.. 11.. 33.. 44.. Figure 16 SISTEMA Cookbook (Version 1.0) - 19 - 4 Transfer to SISTEMA 4.6.1 Entering blocks Once the subsystems have been formed, further specification is necessary (exception: 4.5 Encapsulated subsystems). When the Category of a subsystem is selected, SISTEMA creates the relevant channels (CH). Under "Channel", the blocks (BL ) are added corre- sponding to the individual components of a channel. If no further subdivision of the blocks is required, the procedure can continue with 4.6.3. If a block is to be further subdivided into elements (always necessary with components for which the B is stated), the following set- 10d tings are required: a) In block (1.) under "MTTF " (2.), select "Determine MTTF -value from elements" (3.) d d (Figure 17). 22.. 33.. 11..
