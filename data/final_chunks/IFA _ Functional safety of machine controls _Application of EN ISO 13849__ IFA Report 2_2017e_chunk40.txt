linked contact elements. The averaging formula returns a result of 61% (“low”) for DC . avg • Adequate measures against common cause failure (85 points): separation (15), diversity (20), overvoltage protec- tion etc. (15) and environmental conditions (25 + 10) • The combination of the control elements in the “light barriers” subsystem satisfies Category 2 with a high MTTF D of the functional channel (32 years) and low DC (61%). This results in an average probability of dangerous failure avg PFH of 1.9 · 10-6 per hour. D The following assumptions are made for the “main contactor relay” subsystem: • B = 1,300,000 cycles [S] with an n of 76,800 cycles per year. This leads to an MTTF of 169 years, which in 10D op D accordance with the standard is capped to 100 years. The structure satisfies Category 1; DC and common cause avg failures are not therefore relevant. The resulting average probability of dangerous failure is 1.1 · 10-6 per hour. • Addition of the average probabilities of dangerous failure of the two subsystems results in a PFH of 3.0 · 10-6 per D hour. This satisfies PL c. • If it is anticipated that a demand will be made upon the safety function more frequently than assumed for the Cate- gory 2 designated architecture (the ratio is lower than 100:1, i.e. more frequently than once every 5 hours), this can be allowed for accordance with Annex K, Note 1 of the standard by an additional penalty of 10% down to a ratio of 25:1. In the case with three light barriers under consideration here, the “light barriers” subsystem still attains a PFH of 2.1 · 10-6 per hour. The average probability of dangerous failure PFH of 3.2 · 10-6 per hour only attains PL b, D D however. For PL c to be attained, the number of light barriers would for example have to be reduced, or compo- nents with a higher MTTF employed. D • In consideration of the estimation erring on the safe side as described above, an operation time (T ) of 17 years is 10D produced for specified replacement of the wearing component Q1.

Functional description • The hazardous movement is stopped if either the stop button S1 or one of the emergency stop devices S3 or S4 is actuated. Only actuation by means of the emergency-stop device S3 is considered in this example. The drive is halted in an emergency in response to actuation of S3: first by deactivation of the emergency stop safety module K4, accompanied by shut-off of the contactor relays K1 and K2. Opening of the make contact K1 on the input I4 of the PLC K5 causes the starting signal on the frequency inverter (FI) T1 to be cancelled via the PLC output O2. Redun- dantly to the K1-K5-T1 chain, opening of the make contact K2 upstream of the contactor relay with drop-out delay K3 128 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS S3.1 K1 K5 T1 K4 S3.2 K2 K3 C1 Q1 initiates a braking timer; upon timeout of the braking timer, the actuating signal for the mains contactor Q1 is inter- rupted. The timer setting is selected such that under unfavourable operating conditions, the machine movement is halted before the mains contactor Q1 has dropped out. • Functional stopping of the drive following a stop command is initiated by opening of the two break contacts of the stop button S1. As with stopping in an emergency, the status is first queried by the PLC K5 via the input I0, and the FI is shut down by resetting of the PLC output O2. Redundantly to this process, the contactor relay K3 is shut-off – with drop-out delay provided by the capacitor C1 – and following timeout of the set braking time, the activation signal to the mains contactor Q1 is interrupted. • In the event of failure of the PLC K5, the frequency inverter T1, the mains contactor Q1, the contactor relays K1/ K2 or the contactor relay with drop-out delay K3, stopping of the drive is nevertheless
