Although The life cycle of the SRP/CS begins with specification of EN ISO 13849-1 contains no explicit provision to this the safety functions. Besides particular aspects of various effect, the concept of the life cycle must also be taken up safety functions, EN ISO 13849-1 also lists general aspects during design and integration of one or more SRP/CSs, that are a minimum requirement in such a specification. in order for the activities to be structured appropriately. The description of the standard in Chapter 4 also shows A specification of this kind sets out, at the beginning of clearly that the iterative process described in the standard the design process, the framework for all parties involved. for the design of the safety-related parts of control sys- It constitutes a set of requirements specifications; in no tems is a process subdivided into individual phases.

Since an SRP/CS constitutes parts of a machine, requi- rements in virtually any phase of the machine's life cycle may also have an influence upon an SRP/CS.
