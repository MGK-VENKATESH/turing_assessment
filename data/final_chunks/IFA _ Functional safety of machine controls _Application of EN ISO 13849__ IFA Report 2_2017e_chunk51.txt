is a position switch with a dirct opening contact in accordance with IEC 60947-5-1, Annex K. • The supply conductors to the position switches are laid separately or with protection. • Faults in the actuating and operating mechanism are detected by the use of two position switches differing in the principle of their operation (break and make contacts). • Q1 and Q2 possess mirror contacts in accordance with IEC 60947-4-1, Annex F. The PLC K1 satisfies the normative requirements described in subclause 6.3.

The risk of a hazard on a machine a B of 20 · 106 switching cycles [M]. For position D 10D switch B2 (make contact), the B is 100,000 switching cycles [M]. At 365 working days, 16 working hours per day 10D and a cycle time of 1 hour, n for these components is 5,840 cycles per year and the MTTF is 34,246.6 years for B1 op D and 171 years for B2. For the contactors Q1 and Q2, the B value corresponds under inductive load (AC 3) to an elec- 10 trical durability of 1,300,000 switching cycles [M]. On the assumption that 50% of failures are dangerous, the B 10D value is produced by doubling of the B value. The above assumed value for n results in an MTTF of 4,452 years 10 op D for Q1 and Q2. An MTTF value of 15 years [M] is substituted for the PLC, doubling of which results in an MTTF value D of 30 years. The combination of B1 and Q2 results in an MTTF of 3,940 years for the first channel; B2, K1 and Q2 D contribute to an MTTF of 25.4 years in the second channel. Altogether, the MTTF value symmetrized over both D D channels is 70 years per channel (“high”). The position switch B2 exhibits a limited operation time of 17.1 years. Its replacement in good time is recommended. • DC : the DC of 99% for B1 and B2 is based upon plausibility monitoring of the two switching states in the PLC K1. avg The DC of 99% for the contactors Q1 and Q2 is derived from readback via mirror contacts, also in K1. Owing to the possibility of fault detection by the process, a DC of 60% is assumed for K1. Averaging thus produces a DC of avg 66.2% (“low”). • Adequate measures against common cause failure (65 points): separation (15), overvoltage protection etc. (15) and environmental conditions (25 + 10) • The combination of the control elements satisfies Category 3 with a high MTTF (70 years) and low DC (66.2%). D avg This results in an average probability of dangerous failure of 1.6 · 10-7 per hour. This satisfies PL d. 161 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS Figure 8.36: Determining of the PL by means of SISTEMA 162 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS 163 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS 8.2.19 Interlocking device with guard locking – Category 3 – PL d (Example 19) i Changes with respect to the second edition (BGIA Report 2/2008e): The example was comprehensively revised.

Functional description • Access to a hazardous movement is prevented by a guard door with guard locking until the moving part has come to rest (guard locking safety function). The door is held closed by a spring-actuated pin (the locking element) of a solenoid that prevents the actuator being withdrawn from the switch head until the locking solenoid is actuated. • According to the manufacturer, the guard locking has a fail-safe locking element. 164 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS B2.1 K4 Guard locking K2 Mechanic B2.2 K5 •
