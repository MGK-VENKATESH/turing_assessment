value of 50 years [E] is assumed for the PLC K1. A B value of 20,000,000 cycles [S] applies for the D 10D exhaust valve 0V1. At actuation once daily on 240 working days, the MTTF value for 0V1 is 833,333 years. The D MTTF of the test channel is thus 37.5 years. D • DC : the DC of 60% for 1V1 is based upon comparison of the distance/time characteristic of the hazardous move- avg ment in conjunction with the switching status of the directional control valve. This is also the DC (“low”). avg • Adequate measures against common cause failure (85 points): separation (15), diversity (20), overvoltage protec- tion etc. (15) and environmental conditions (25 + 10) • The combination of the pneumatic control elements satisfies Category 2 with a high MTTF (72.3 years) and low D DC (60%). This results in an average probability of dangerous failure of 7.6 · 10-7 per hour. This satisfies PL d. avg The addition of further SRP/CS in the form of subsystems for completion of the safety function may under certain circumstances result in a lower PL. The wearing element 1V1 should be replaced approximately every seven years (T ). 10D More detailed reference • VDMA technical rule 24584: Safety functions of regulated and unregulated (fluid) mechanical systems (08.16) Figure 8.22: Determining of the PL by means of SISTEMA 134 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS 135 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS 8.2.12 Tested hydraulic valve (subsystem) – Category 2 – PL d (Example 12) K1 1S3 G hazardous 1A movement 1S3 1V3b 1V3a K1 K1 1V3 K1 Inputs a b PLC Outputs Q1 L 1V2 Q1 1V1 1Z2 1Z1 M 1S1 1S2 Figure 8.23: 1M 1P 3 Hydraulic valve with electronic testing for the control of hazardous movements Safety functions • Safety-related stop function: stopping of a hazardous movement and prevention of unexpected start-up from the rest position • Only the hydraulic part of the control system is shown here, in the form of a subsystem. Further safety-related control components (e.g. safeguards and electrical logic elements) must be added in the form of subsystems for completion of the safety function. Functional description • Hazardous movements are controlled by the directional control valve 1V3. • Failure of the directional control valve 1V3 between functional tests may result in loss of the safety function. The probability of failure is dependent upon the reliability of the directional control valve. • Testing of the safety function is forced via the PLC K1 by means of a displacement measurement system 1S3. Testing takes place at suitable intervals and in response to a demand of the safety function. Detection of a failure of 1V3 leads to the hydraulic pump 1M/1P being switched off by the contactor Q1. 136 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS 1V3 1S3 K1 Q1 • Interruption of the hazardous movement by the hydraulic pump generally results in a longer overrun. The distance from the hazard zone must be selected in consideration of the longer overrun. • The test function must not be impaired by failure of the directional control valve. Failure of the test function must not lead to failure of the directional control valve. Design features • Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. • 1V3 is a directional control valve with closed centre position, sufficient overlap and spring-centred central position. • The safety-oriented switching position is attained by cancellation of the control signal. • Testing may for example take the form of checking of the distance/time characteristic (displacement measurement system 1S3) of the hazardous movements in conjunction with the switching position of the directional control valve, with evaluation in a PLC (K1). K1 must not be used for the electrical drive of 1V3. • In order to prevent a systematic failure, the higher-level de-energization function (acting upon the hydraulic pump in this example) is checked at suitable intervals, e.g. daily. • For use in applications with infrequent operator intervention in the hazard zone. This enables the requirement of the designated architecture for Category 2 to be satisfied. The requirement is for testing to be performed immedi- ately upon a demand being made upon the safety function, and for the total time for detection of the failure and placing of the machine in a non-hazardous state, for example in consideration of the overrun, to be shorter than the time to attainment of the hazard (see also EN ISO 13855 and cf. subclause 6.2.14) • The standard component K1 is employed in accordance with the information in subclause 6.3.10. • The software (SRASW) is programmed in accordance with the requirements for PL b (downgraded owing to diver- sity) and the information in subclause 6.3. Calculation of the probability of failure • MTTF of the functional channel: an MTTF of 150 years is assumed for the directional control valve 1V3 [M]. This is D D also the MTTF value for the functional channel, which is first capped to 100 years. D • MTTF of the test channel: an MTTF value of 91 years [M] is assumed for the displacement measurement system D D 1S3. An MTTF value of 50 years [E] is assumed for the PLC K1. A B value of 1,300,000 cycles [S] applies for the D 10D contactor Q1. At actuation once daily on 240 working days, the MTTF value for Q1 is 54,166 years. The MTTF of D D the test channel is thus 32.3 years. The MTTF of the functional channel must therefore be reduced to 64.5 years in D accordance with the underlying analysis model. • DC : the DC of 60% for 1V3 is based upon the comparison of the distance/time characteristic of the hazardous avg movement in conjunction with the switching status of the directional control valve.
