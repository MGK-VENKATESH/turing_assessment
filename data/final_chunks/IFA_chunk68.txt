The signals are read into a standard safety module K2, which is looped into the enabling path for the electrical pilot control K1 (a conventional PLC) for the hydraulic actuators. Hazardous movements or states are controlled on the actuator side by three directional control valves (1V3, 1V4 and 1V5). In response to a demand of the safety function, all valves are de-energized elec- trically by K2, and are placed by their return springs in the closed centre position (1V4) or closed position (1V3 and 1V5). The oil return from the end of the cylinder above the piston to the reservoir is interrupted simultaneously by the valves 1V4 and 1V5. 1V5 is a poppet valve that is designed to shut offthe volumetric flow without leakage. Valve 1V4, which also controls the direction of movement of the cylinder, is a piston-type directional control valve that also exhibits a certain degree of leakage in the closed centre position. Although the valve 1V3 is only indirectly involved in the stop function, it may have a negative impact upon the safety function. Should 1V3 and 1V4 stick at 222 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS B1 1V4 K2 B2 1V3 1V5 1S3 K1 1S4 1S5 the same time, pressure builds up at the end of the cylinder above the piston, whilst the end below it remains shut off by 1V5. Owing to the pressure ratio in the cylinder, the pressure-relief valve 1V6 then opens and the ram of the press drops. • Failure of one of the valves does not result in loss of the safety function. All valves are actuated cyclically. • Each valve is equipped with a position monitoring facility, 1S3, 1S4 and 1S5, for fault detection purposes. Failure of any of the three valves is detected in the conventional PLC K1, which prevents the next hazardous movement from being initiated following a fault. • A single fault in one safety component does not result in loss of the safety function. In addition, single faults are detected at or prior to the next demand. An accumulation of undetected faults does not result in loss of the safety function. Design features • Basic and well-tried safety principles and the requirements of Category B are observed. Protective circuits (such as contact protection) as described in the initial paragraphs of Chapter 8 are implemented. • A stable arrangement of the guard is assured for actuation of the position switch. • The switch B1 is a position switch with a direct opening contact in accordance with IEC60947-5-1, Annex K. • The safety module K2 satisfies all requirements for Category 4 and PL e. • The supply conductors to the position switches are laid separately or with protection. • A standard PLC without safety functions is employed for K1. • The valves 1V3, 1V4 and 1V5 possess a closed centre position/closed position with sufficient overlap, spring- centred central position/return, and position monitoring. • The safety-oriented switching position is assumed from any position by cancellation of the control signal. • The pressure-relief valve 1V6 for protecting the cylinder 1A and the components below it against the effect of the pressure ratio satisfies the requirements of EN 693:2001, subclause 5.2.4.4. Calculation of the probability of failure • K2 is considered as a subsystem with a probability of failure of 2.3 · 10-9 per hour [M]. The remaining part of the control system is grouped separately by electromechanical and hydraulic components to form two Category 4 sub- systems, the probability of failure of which is calculated below. • MTTF : for the position switch B1 with direct opening action, the B is 20 · 106 switching cycles [M]. For the electri- D 10D cal make contact of the position switch B2, the B is 1,000,000 switching cycles [M]. At 365 working days, 16 wor- 10D king hours per day and a cycle time of 10 minutes, n is 35,040 cycles per year for these components, and the op MTTF is 5,707 years for B1 and 285 for B2. An MTTF of 150 years [M] is assumed for each of the valves 1V3, 1V4 and D D 1V5. This yields an MTTF value per channel of 100 and 88 years (“high”) respectively for the two subsystems. D 223 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS • DC : the DC of 99% forB1 and B2 is based upon plausibility monitoring of the two switching states in K2. The DC avg of 99% for the two valves is based upon direct monitoring of the switching states by the PLC K1. This results in a DC of 99% (“high”) for the two subsystems. avg • Measures against common cause failures (75 points) for the two subsystems: separation (15), well-tried compo- nents (5), FMEA (5), protection against overvoltage etc. (15) and environmental conditions (25 + 10) • The electromechanical and hydraulic parts of the control system correspond to Category 4 with a high MTTF and a D high DC (99%). This results in an average probabilities of dangerous failure of 1.3 · 10-9 per hour and 2.1 · 10-8 per avg hour.
