If the height of the physical guard is to be 1,600 mm, the safety distance must be increased to at least 800 mm. Proceed as follows to determine the required height of the top edge of the physical guard for this safety distance: 1. Determine the height of the hazardous point a and find the value in the left-hand column, e.g., 1,000 mm. 2. In this row, find the first column in which the horizontal distance C is less than the safety distance calculated, e.g., the first field with the value “0”. 3. Read the resulting height b for the physical guard in the bottom row, e.g., 1,800 mm.

Distance ring Figure 91: Minimum distance of a two-hand control device Example: Minimum distance for two-hand control device S = (K × T) + C S Minimum distance in millimeters measured from the control to the nearest hazardous point K Parameter in millimeters per second, derived from the data for the approach speeds of the body or parts of the body, usually 1,600 mm/s T Stopping/run-down time of the overall system from when the control is released in seconds C Supplement 250 mm. It might not be required under certain conditions (e.g., covering of the control switch). NOTE - Calculation of the minimum distance: ISO 13855 (type-B standard) Application of reset and restart If a protective device triggers a stop command, the stop status must be maintained until a safe state for a restart exists. The risk assessment may indicate that the stop status must only be ended by means of a manual, separate and intentional reset. The machine can be restarted in a further step. The reset must be performed using a special operated device. The operated device must be able to withstand the foreseeable stresses and must be used properly to prevent unintentional actuation (touch panels may be unsuita‐ ble). Furthermore, the device must be installed in a safe location outside the hazardous area. The hazardous area must be fully visible from this location to ensure that no person is in the hazardous area. The signal from the operated device must enable the controller to issue a separate start command for restarting. The signal processing must ensure that the restart can only take place if all safety functions and protective devices are functional. 110 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION ISO 13849-1 (section 5.2.2) therefore requires that resetting may only occur by releasing the command device from its actuated (ON) position and that the signal processing should detect the falling signal edge of the command device. This means that the acknowl‐ edgment must only occur by releasing the actuating element from its actuated (ON) position. Figure 92: The position of the reset pushbutton allows a full view of the hazardous area when resetting the protective device. Manual resetting is a safety function and must be implemented accordingly, e.g., by applying the ISO 13849-1 or IEC 62061 standards. The signal (on actuation) of the reset device is part of the Machinery Directive are subject to the standard process. The “Essential health and safety requirements” described in Annex I must be met. The manufacturer shall then compile the technical files and apply the CE marking. This process does not require the involvement of a third party (test body or authority). The technical files shall be provided to the national market authorities upon duly reasoned request.
