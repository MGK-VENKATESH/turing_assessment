a brake 2Z1 on the piston rod respectively. The brake 2Z1 is actuated by a control valve 2V1. • Failure of one of these valves or of the brake alone does not result in loss of the safety function. • The directional control valve and the brake are actuated cyclically in the process. 144 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS 1V1 2V1 2Z1 2S1 1S1 • The functioning of the control valve 2V1 is monitored by means of a pressure switch 2S1. Certain faults on the unmonitored directional control valve 1V1 and the unmonitored brake 2Z1 are detected in the work process. In addition, the overrun (distance/time characteristic) during the braking process (dynamic) and/or at start-up of the machine (static) is monitored with the aid of a displacement measurement system 1S1 on the piston rod. An accu- mulation of undetected faults may lead to loss of the safety function. • Testing of the safety function is implemented at suitable intervals, for example at least every eight working hours. • The test function must not be impaired by failure of the brake. Failure of the test function must not lead to failure of the brake. • Should trapped compressed air pose a further hazard, additional measures are required. Design features • Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. • The directional control valve 1V1 features a closed centre position with sufficient overlap and spring-centred central position. • The safety-oriented switching position is assumed from any position by cancellation of the control signal. • Signals from the pressure monitor 2S1 and the displacement measurement system 1S1 are processed for example in the upstream electrical logic (not shown). Calculation of the probability of failure • MTTF : B values of 20,000,000 cycles [S] are assumed for the valves 1V1 and 2V1. At 240 working days, D 10D 16 working hours and a cycle time of 15 seconds, n is 921,600 cycles per year. The MTTF for 1V1 and 2V1 is thus op D 217 years. A B value of 5,000,000 switching cycles [M] is substituted for the mechanical brake on the piston rod 10D 2Z1. This results in an MTTF of 54 years for the mechanical brake. Overall, the resulting symmetrized MTTF value D D per channel is 75 years (“high”). • DC : pressure monitoring of the control signal for the brake results in a DC of 99% for the control valve 2V1. The avg DC for the directional control valve 1V1 is 60% owing to fault detection through the process. Start-up testing of the mechanical brake yields a DC of 75% for 2Z1. Averaging thus produces a DC of 76.5% (“low”). avg • Adequate measures against common cause failure (85 points): separation (15), diversity (20), overvoltage protec- tion etc. (15) and environmental conditions (25 + 10) • The combination of the pneumatic control elements satisfies Category 3 with a high MTTF per channel (75 years) D and low DC (76.5%). This results in an average probability of dangerous failure of 1.1 · 10-7 per hour. This satisfies avg PL d. The addition of further SRP/CS in the form of subsystems for completion of the safety function may under certain circumstances result in a lower PL. • The wearing brake 2Z1 should be replaced at intervals of approximately five years (T ). 10D 145 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS More detailed reference • VDMA technical rule 24584: Safety functions of regulated and unregulated (fluid) mechanical systems (08.16) Figure 8.28: Determining of the PL by means of SISTEMA 146 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS 147 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS 8.2.15 Protective device and hydraulics controlled by PLC – Category 3 – PL d (Example 15) hazardous + + Laser scanner 1A movement S1 START F1 1V5 a b K1 K1 1S3 K1 K1 1S3 Inputs G 1V4 1V3 Safety PLC Outputs K1 1V5a 1V5b 1V2 1V3 Figure 8.29: 1V1 1Z2 Detection zone monitoring by 1Z1 laser scanner with M 1S1 1S2 1M 1P 3 electrohydraulic deactivation of the hazardous movement Safety function • Safety-related stop function, initiated by a protective device: penetration of the laser scanner‘s detection zone results in stopping of the hazardous movement. Functional description • The laser scanner F1 monitors, with its detection zone, the area in which movement of the cylinder 1A may present a danger to the operator. The output signal of the laser scanner is read in on two channels by the safety PLC K1. Following any violation of the detection zone, the next movement must be enabled by actuation of a start button S1 evaluated in K1 (restart interlock). K1 controls the movement of 1A with the aid of the hydraulic part of the control system. • The hydraulic part of the control system comprises a two-channel arrangement. The first channel comprises direc- tional control valve 1V3, which acts upon the pilot-operated non-return valve 1V4. In the closed position, 1V4 blocks movements of 1A. The second channel consists of the directional control valve 1V5, which in its closed centre posi- tion also prevents movement of 1A. • 1V5 is actuated cyclically in the process. 1V3 and 1V4 close only in the event of violation of the detection zone (demand of the safety function), but at least once per shift. • Direct position monitoring 1S3 is implemented on 1V4 and evaluated in K1 as a fault detection measure. Faults in 1V5 can be detected via the process owing to the function. An accumulation of undetected faults in the hydraulic part of the control system may lead to loss of the safety function. 148 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS 1V3 1V4 F1 K1 1V5 1S3 Design features • Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. Protective circuits (such as contact protection) as described in the initial paragraphs of Chapter 8 are implemented. • Faults in the conductors to F1 and K1 must not be hazardous in their effects.
