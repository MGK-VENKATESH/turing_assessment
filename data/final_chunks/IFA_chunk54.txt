S4.1, S4.2 and K2, DC is 99% owing to plausibility testing in K4. An adequate test rate of the emergency-stop device is assured (refer to the information in subclauses 6.2.14 and D.2.5.1). The averaging formula for DC returns a result of 65% (“low”). avg • Adequate measures against common cause failure (85 points): separation (15), diversity (20), overvoltage protec- tion etc. (15) and environmental conditions (25 + 10) • The combination of the control elements satisfies Category 3 with a high MTTF of each channel (72 years) and D a low DC (65%). Together with the FI T1, this results in an average probability of dangerous failure PFH of avg D 1.7 · 10-7 per hour. This satisfies PL d. Safe stop initiated by the ESPE K3: • The ESPE K3 is available as a commercial safety component. Its probability of failure PFH is 3.0 · 10-8 per hour [M], D and is added at the end of the calculation. • The probability of failure of the “PLC/electromechanical” two-channel structure is calculated using the same MTTF D and DC values as above. The component K2 however is not involved in performance of this safety function. The results are: an MTTF for each channel of 72 years (“high”) and a DC of 65% (“low”). For Category 3, this yields an D avg average probabilitycan be reduced not only by the control system, but also for example by a guard, The Categories continue to be the basis upon which the such as a guard door, or by personal protective equip- PL is determined.

Functionaldescription • This example shows implementation of the SLS safety function with a frequency inverter without integrated safety function. The SLS safety function is used for example for inching mode during servicing tasks. • A hazardous movement is safely prevented or interrupted when the safety guard is open. Opening of the safety guard is detected by two position switches B1 and B2 employing a break-contact/make-contact element combi- nation. When the pushbutton S1 is actuated, a movement at a safely limited speed (inching mode) is initiated by means of the safety PLC K1. The two processing channels within the PLC each process a set limit value. The actual value of the limited speed on the inputs I3.0 and I3.1 of K1 is monitored by two separate rotary encoders G1 and G2. Each channel of the PLC performs the desired/actual speed comparison independently. Should the speed not be reduced successfully to the limited value by means of T1, K1 can initiate a halt by blocking the start/stop signal and servo enable on the frequency inverter. The power supply to T1 is also
