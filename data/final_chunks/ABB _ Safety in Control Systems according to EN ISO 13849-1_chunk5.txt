switch Logic unit Machine 1 For the full safety function to be performed you require all B1 K1 Q2 the components to be working. Note that if B1 or K1 has a Interlocked switch Logic unit Machine 2 dangerous malfunction, the entire safety function is disabled. B1 K1 Q3 However, if for example machine Q1 has a dangerous Interlocked switch Logic unit Machine 3 malfunction, and is not shut down, machines Q2 and Q3 will still be shut down. One disadvantage in considering looking at the safety functions, especially where a different the safety function in this way is that you may have trouble PL is required for the safety functions above. If machine Q1 r achieving the PL r required. But if you achieve the PL r is a robot and machine Q2 is a conveyor which is designed required, you can use the theoretical approach. to have negligible risks, the different PL required to protect r against risks from Q1 and Q2 will also be different. This practical approach is therefore the one recommended.

(No 047, Date 05/2010) Examples of safety functions from Case Study 3 - safety PLC Pluto The risk assessment for the safety functions needed for Interlock switch B1, Eden, is to cut the power to all machines the risks associated with the robot was S2, F2, P2, which in the danger zone: resulted in PL=e. The same assessment was made for the • Robot Q1 (PFH , = 5.79·10-8) r D Q1 hydraulic press: PL=e. The assessment of the pneumatic • Hydraulic press Q2 (PFH , = 8·10-8) r D Q2 machining tool is S2, F2, P1 giving PL= d due to the fact that • Pneumatic machining tool Q3 (PFH , = 2·10-7). r D Q3 the assessment is that there is the possibility of avoiding risk. Theoretical approach If you use the practical approach the safety functions are as follows: Robot: PFH , + PFH , + PFH , = 4,5·10-9 + 2·10-9 + 5.79·10-8 = 6.44·10-8 PL e D B1 D K1 D Q1 Hydraulic press: PFH , + PFH , + PFH , = 4.5·10-9 + 2·10-9 + 8·10-8 = 8.65·10-8 PL e D B1 D K1 D Q2 Pneumatic machining tool: PFH , + PFH , + PFH , = 4.5·10-9 + 2·10-9 + 2·10-7 = 2.07·10-7 PL d D B1 D K1 D Q3 This is to be done in a similar way with other safety functions for the cell. For each safety device, you define the machines it affects, and establish the various safety functions according to this. Theoretical approach How would it have worked if you had used the theoretical approach? Would the safety function have achieved PL e? All machines: PFH , + PFH , + PFH , + PFH , + PFH , D B1 D K1 D Q1 D Q2 D Q3 = 4,5·10-9 + 2·10-9 + 5.79·10-8 + 8·10-8 + 2·10-7 = 3.44·10-7 PL d In this case, the safety function would therefore have not achieved a total PL e, which was required for the risks associated with the robot and hydraulic press. Conclusions • Use the practical approach. • Use safety devices/logic units with high reliability (low PFH ) to make it easy to achieve the PL required. D r • With Vital or Pluto, it is easier to achieve the PL required. r Safety in control systems according to EN ISO 13849-1 | 15 SISTEMA A tool for determining performance level (PL) and generating technical documentation EN ISO 13849-1 requires calculations.

Various benefits in comparison to EN ISO 13849-1 Flexibility Programmable Pluto AS-i Not programmable Pluto All-Master Vital Safety PLC with static and dynamic safety Dynamic "doubled up" inputs. safety signal that tests a sensor, for example, 200 times per second. Master Safety relay Slaves Double static inputs that Traditional safety PLC only test the switches each Master-Slave with static inputs time they are used. Number of machines/different stops To achieve PL e using a conventional safety relay, such as achieve PL e to EN ISO 13849-1. The Vital module is based RT9, you need to use both channels on the input side and on a dynamic single-channel concept and can replace only connect a single safety device. Under certain conditions multiple safety relays. A similar solution, although more PL d can be achieved by connecting multiple two-channel flexible, is safety PLC Pluto. Pluto, like Vital, is able to make devices to a safety relay, but this is not a generally accepted use of dynamic signals to achieve maximum reliability. method. Vital is a safety controller that allows you to connect and monitor a variety of safety components in series, and to Benefits of Vital Benefits of Pluto • It is possible to connect up to 30 safety components • Pluto is an all-master-system with communications through a channel in line with PL e across a separate safety bus • No programming required • Greater flexibility facilitates the design of protection • The option
