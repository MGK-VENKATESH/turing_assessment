actuates a contactor Q1. The dropping out of Q1 interrupts or prevents hazardous movements or states. • The safety function cannot be maintained with all component failures, and is dependent upon the reliability of the components. • No measures for fault detection are implemented. • Removal of the protective device is not detected. Design features • Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. Protective circuits (such as contact protection) as described in the initial paragraphs of Chapter 8 are implemented. The closed-circuit current principle is employed as a basic safety principle. Earthing of the control circuit is regarded as a well-tried safety principle. • Switch B1 is a position switch with direct opening contact in accordance with IEC 60947-5-1, Annex K and is there- fore regarded as a well-tried component. The break contact interrupts the circuit directly mechanically when the safeguard is not in the safe position. • Contactor Q1 is a well-tried component provided the additional conditions in accordance with Table D.3 of EN ISO 13849-2 are met. 116 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS B1 Q1 • A position switch is employed for position monitoring. A stable arrangement of the safeguard is assured for actua- tion of the position switch. The actuating elements of the position switch are protected against displacement. Only rigid mechanical parts are employed (no spring elements acting in the direction of the actuating force). • The actuating stroke for the position switch complies with the manufacturer‘s specification. Calculation of the probability of failure • MTTF : an MTTF of 20 · 106 switching cycles [M] is stated for B1. At 365 working days, 16 working hours per day and D D a cycle time of 10 minutes, the n for these components is 35,040 cycles per year, and the MTTF is 5,707 years. For op D the contactor Q1, the B value corresponds under inductive load (AC 3) to an electrical durability of 1,300,000 swit- 10 ching cycles [M]. If 50% of failures are assumed to be dangerous, the B value is produced by doubling of the B 10D 10 value. The above assumed value for n results in an MTTF of 742 years for Q1. The combination of B1 and Q1 results op D in an MTTF of 656 years for each channel. This value is capped to 100 years (“high”). D • DC and measures against common cause failures are not relevant in Category 1. avg • The electromechanical control system satisfies Category 1 with a high MTTF (100 years). This results in an average D probability of dangerous failure of 1.1 · 10-6 per hour. This satisfies PL c. The PL of b is therefore surpassed. r More detailed reference • IEC 60947-5-1: Low-voltage switchgear and controlgear – Part 5-1: Control circuit devices and switching elements – Electromechanical control circuit devices (2009) + A1 (2012) Figure 8.12: Determining of the PL by means of SISTEMA 117 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS 8.2.6 Start/stop facility with emergency stop device – Category 1 – PL c (Example 6) L S1 Emergency stop S2 Q1 Q1 START S3 STOP M 3~ Q1 Figure 8.13: Combined start/stop facility with emergency stop device Safety function • Emergency stop function, STO – safe torque off by actuation of the emergency stop device Functional description • Hazardous movements or states are de-energized by interruption of the control voltage of contactor Q1 when the emergency stop device S1 is actuated. • The safety function cannot be maintained with all component failures, and is dependent upon the reliability of the components. • No measures for fault detection are implemented.

It is manufactured in accordance with D IEC 60947-5-5. In accordance with EN ISO 13849-1, Table C.1, a B value of 100,000 switching cycles may be 10D applied in this case for emergency stop devices, irrespective of the load [S]. For the contactor Q1, the B value cor- 10 responds under inductive load (AC 3) to an electrical durability of 1,300,000 switching cycles [M]. On the assump- tion that 50% of failures are dangerous, the B value is produced by doubling of the B value.
