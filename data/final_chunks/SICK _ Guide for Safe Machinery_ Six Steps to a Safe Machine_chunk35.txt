In addition, they describe protection against direct contact with live parts. This protection is always required, even at low voltages. All parts that remain live after the isolation of the power shall be designed to at least enclosure rating IP 2x, control cabinets shall be designed to at least enclosure rating IP 54. 34 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 2 SAFE DESIGN (INHERENTLY SAFE DESIGN) Table 10: Overview of protection classes according to IEC 60529 15° 1st digit: 2nd digit: Protection against ingress Protection against ingress of water (no steam, no other liquids!) of solid foreign bodies IP ...0 IP ...1 IP ...2 IP ...3 IP ...4 IP ...5 IP ...6 IP ...7 IP ...8 IP ...9K No Dripping water Spraying Spraying Jet Jet Immersion 100 bar, protection water water water water, 16 l/min., vertical at an angle heavy temporary continuous 80 °C IP 0...

Requirements: • All machinery shall be fitted with one or more emergency stop control devices, that bring the machine to a shutdown in an emergency. • Every machine shall be equipped with a control for stopping the machine in normal operation. 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 35 Subject to change without notice 2 SAFE DESIGN (INHERENTLY SAFE DESIGN) • At least one category 0 stop function shall be available. Additional category 1 and/or 2 stop functions may be necessary for safety-related or function-related reasons on the machine. • A command to stop the machine shall have a higher priority than the commands for putting the machine into operation. Stop categories according to IEC 60204-1 Safety-related and function-related aspects in machines result in stop functions in various categories. Stop catego‐ ries shall not to be confused with the categories according to ISO 13849-1. Table 11: Stop categories according to IEC 60204-1 Stop category 0 Supply of power to the drive elements is isolated (uncontrolled stopping) Stop category 1 Machine is placed in a safe state, only then the supply of power to the drive elements is isolated Stop category 2 Machine is placed in a safe state but the supply of power to the drive elements is not disconnected NOTE - See also section "Emergency stop", page 49. NOTE - Stop categories, see “Electrical equipment of machines: IEC 60204-1”. Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) Electromagnetic compatibility is “the ability of a device, unit of equipment or system to function satisfactorily in its electromagnetic environment without introducing intolerable electromagnetic disturbances to anything in that environment”. The machine and the components used shall be selected and verified so that they can withstand or are immune to the expected disturbances. Increased requirements apply to safety components. Electromagnetic disturbances can arise from the following causes: • Fast, transient, electrical disturbances (burst) • Surge voltages, e.g., caused by lightning strikes to the grid • Electromagnetic fields • High-frequency disturbance (neighboring cables) • Electrostatic discharge (ESD) The limits for interference immunity and interference emission are different for industrial and residential applica‐ tions. More stringent requirements apply to components in the industrial sector. On the one hand they must withstand stronger disturbances, but on the other hand they are allowed to interfere more strongly. Components that meet the RF interference requirements in the industrial sector may cause RF interference in residential areas. The following table shows examples of the typical interference immunity in a number of areas of application, in each case in the frequency range from 900 to 2 000 MHz.
