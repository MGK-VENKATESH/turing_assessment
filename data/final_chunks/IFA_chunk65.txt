of all the devices. S1 is evaluated in a safety module K1, which actuates two redun- dant contactor relays K2 and K3. • The signals from the emergency stop devices are read redundantly into the safety module K1 for fault detection. K1 also features internal test measures. The contactor relays K2 and K3 are also monitored in K1, by means of mechanically linked readback contacts. K2 and K3 are switched by the switch S4 at each start-up command, appro- ximately twice each month. An accumulation of more than two faults in the period between two successive actua- tions can lead to loss of the safety function. • It is not assumed that more than one emergency stop device is pressed simultaneously. • Organizational measures ensure that each emergency-stop device is actuated at least once a year. Design features • Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. Protective circuits (such as contact protection) as described in the initial paragraphs of Chapter 8 are implemented. • The emergency stop devices S1, S2 and S3 are switching devices with direct opening contacts in accordance with IEC 60947-5-1, Annex K. • The supply conductors to the switching devices are laid with protection. 206 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS S1.1 K2 K1 S1.2 K3 • The safety module K1 satisfies all requirements for Category 4 and PL e. • K2 and K3 possess mechanically linked contact elements to IEC 60947-5-1, Annex L. Remark • The emergency stop function is a complementary protective measure to EN ISO 12100 [3]. Calculation of the probability of failure • S1, S2 and S3 are standard emergency stop devices to EN ISO 13850. In the two-channel model, aB value of 10D 100,000 switching cycles [S] is substituted for each contact of an emergency-stop device. The probability of failure of the safety module K1 is added at the end of the calculation (2.3 · 10-9 per hour [M], suitable for PL e). • MTTF : for the contactor relays K2 and K3, the B value corresponds under inductive load (AC 3) to an electrical D 10 durability of 1,000,000 switching cycles [M]. On the assumption that 50% of failures are dangerous, the B value 10D is produced by doubling of the B value. With twelve demands upon the emergency stop function and 24 start 10 commands per year, n is 36 cycles per year and the MTTF is 55,556 years. This is also the symmetrized MTTF for op D D the channel, which is capped to 100 years (“high”). • DC : the DC for K2 and K3 and for S1.1 and S1.2 is 90%. The DC is based upon testing and the detection of cross- avg circuits by the safety module K1. This is also the DC (“medium”). An adequate test rate of the emergency-stop avg devices is assured (refer to the information in subclauses 6.2.14 and D.2.5.1). • Adequate measures against common cause failure (70 points): separation (15), well-tried components (5), over- voltage protection etc. (15) and environmental conditions (25 + 10) • At twelve demands upon the emergency stop function per year, the average probability of dangerous failure PFH D for the emergency stop device S1 is 4.3 · 10-8 per hour. • The subsystem K2/K3 satisfies Category 3 with a high MTTF (100 years) and medium DC (90%). This results in an D avg average probability of dangerous failure of 4.3 · 10-8 per hour. Following addition of the subsystem K1, the average probabilityof dangerous failure is 8.8 · 10-8 per hour. This satisfies PL e. The PL of d is thus surpassed. r 207 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS Figure 8.57: Determining of the PL by means of SISTEMA 208 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS 209 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS 8.2.30 Contactor monitoring module – Category 3 – PL e (Example 30) L L L Safeguard Q1 K1 Q2 Safety module M 3 Q2 Q2 Q2 Feedback F1 Contact monitoring module Figure 8.58: Initiation of STO Q1 U < (safe torque off) by means of a safety module and contactor monitoring module Safety function • Safety-related stop function, initiated by a guard: opening of the interlocking device initiates the safety function STO (safe torque off). Functional description • A hazard zone is safeguarded by means of a guard, opening of which is detected by a safety module K1. The safety module actuates a contactor Q2 and a combination comprising a contactor monitoring module F1 and an undervol- tage release Q1. The dropping-out of Q2 interrupts hazardous movements and prevents hazardous states from ari- sing. The contactor monitoring module F1 has the function of monitoring the main contacts of the contactor Q2 for contact welding. Should Q2 fail to drop out, F1 trips the upstream circuit-breaker or motor starter Q1 via the latter‘s undervoltage release. The circuit-breaker or motor starter then switches off the motor. • The safety function is preserved in the event of a component failure. • An accumulation of faults between two successive actuations can lead to loss of the safety function. 210 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS Q2 K1 F1 Q1 Design features • The circuit-breaker Q1 is checked regularly by means of a test function that is to be implemented manually. The interval between the tests shouldnot exceed one-hundredth of the MTTF of Q1; the test could be performed for D example during maintenance of the machine. The contactor Q2 is tested continually by the contactor monitoring module. Loss of the safety function between the tests, as is possible with Category 2, cannot occur. The single-fault safety is thus assured and the requirements of Category 3 are met. • Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. Protective circuits (such as contact protection) as described in the initial paragraphs of Chapter 8 are implemented. • For reasons of simplification, details of the safeguard have been omitted from the presentation. • The safeguard acts upon a safety
