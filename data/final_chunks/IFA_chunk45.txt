Parts of the circuit structure as shown are not explicitly designed to prevent possible hazards resulting from un expected movement of the studio hoist. • As the calculation of the probability of failure shows, the circuit structure used attains PL d for the safety function under consideration here. Use of the risk graph to determine the required Performance Level PL with the para- r meters S2, F1 and P1 in accordance with DIN 56950-2, subclause A.1.2.3.3 results in a PL of c, provided the stu- r dio hoist is operated under supervision and only by skilled personnel. Should this not be the case, a PL of d is r required. Calculation of the probability of failure • Components are grouped into blocks in Figure 8.25 in the interests of clarity. K9 to K15 each contain one optocoup- ler and two resistances. K16 to K18 additionally each contain a transistor for driving the downstream contactor relays. • For application of the simplified procedure for estimation of the achieved PL, the components in the circuit are assigned to the blocks of the designated architecture for Category 2 as follows: I: B1 L: K10, K6, K1, K2, K16, K3, K17, K22 O: K19, K20 TE: B2, K11, K12, K9, K5, K7, K8, K4, K18, K13, K14, K15 OTE: K21 141 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS • MTTF : the MTTF values required for the calculation were sourced primarily from EN ISO 13849-1 [S], and from D D SN 29500-2 and SN 29500-14 [D]. The following valuesare substituted for B1 and B2: B : 100,000 cycles [E]; 10D n : 10 cycles per year. For the contactor relays K19 to K21: B : 400,000 cycles [S]; n : 10 cycles per day on op 10D op 365 working days. An MTTF of 1,141 years [D] is substituted for the microcontroller K1. The following MTTF values D D are sub stituted for the electronic components [D]: 4,566 years for the watchdog K8, 5,707 years for the optocoup- lers K9 to K18, 22,831 years for the logic gates K2 to K6, 38,052 years for the voltage monitor K7, 45,662 years for transistors and 228,310 years for resistors. An MTTF of 228 years [E] is assumed for the power supply K22. Summa- D tion of the failure rates for all components of the functional channel (blocks I, L and O) produces an MTTF value of D 128 years. This value is capped to 100 years (“high”) in accordance with the requirements of the standard. • The MTTF of the test channel is produced by summation of the failure rates of all components of blocks TE and D OTE. The resulting value of 389 years is greater than or equal to half of the MTTF of the functional channel. D • DC : the DC is 60% for B1, K10 and K6 owing to cross monitoring of B1 and B2 in K1 with a low demand rate upon avg the safety function. The DC is 60% for K1 owing to temporal monitoring of program sequence and self-tests of sim- ple effectiveness. The DC is 99% for K2, K3, K16, K17, K19 and K20 owing to direct monitoring by means of mecha- nically linked contact elements. For K22, the DC is 99%. The averaging formula returns a result of 93% (“medium”)for DC . avg • Adequate measures against common cause failure (65 points): separation (15), overvoltage protection (15) and environmental conditions (25 + 10) • The combination of the control elements satisfies Category 2 with a high MTTF of the functional channel D (100 years) and medium DC (93%). This results in an average probability of dangerous failure PFH of avg D 2.3 · 10-7 per hour. This satisfies PL d.

Further SRP/CS (e.g. safeguards and electrical logic elements) must be added in the form of subsystems for completion of the safety function. Functional description • Hazardous movements are controlled/stopped redundantly by a directional control valve 1V1 anda brake 2Z1 on the piston rod respectively. The brake 2Z1 is actuated by a control valve 2V1. • Failure of one of these valves or of the brake alone does not result in loss of the safety function. • The directional control valve and the brake are actuated cyclically in the process. 144 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS 1V1 2V1 2Z1 2S1 1S1 • The functioning of the control valve 2V1 is monitored by means of a pressure switch 2S1. Certain faults on the unmonitored directional control valve 1V1 and the unmonitored brake 2Z1 are detected in the work process. In addition, the overrun (distance/time characteristic) during the braking process (dynamic) and/or at start-up of the machine (static) is monitored with the aid of a displacement measurement system 1S1 on the piston rod. An accu- mulation of undetected faults may lead to loss of the safety function. • Testing
