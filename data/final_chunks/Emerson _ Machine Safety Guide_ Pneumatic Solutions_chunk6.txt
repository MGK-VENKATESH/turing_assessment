functions in one device • Eliminates air exhaust across the entire machine • Increases machine productivity • Maximizes flexibility Emerson expertise – AVENTICS-G3| Machine safety 33 Series G3/580 electronic platforms The Series G3 is a fully modular system with an innovative clip design. It enables easy module removal and replacement as well as short-term design changes without disassembling the valve system. This ensures that projects are delivered on time. The Series G3 also features an innovative graphic display that shows clear-text diagnostic messages. It provides clear feedback when commissioning valves, enabling faster commissioning processes and shorter critical phases. Faults are easier to diagnose, and operation can continue much faster. Series 580 The new Series 580 provides a compact and cost-effective fieldbus electronics platform for applications that do not require the extensive capabilities of the G3. It is equipped with the same G3 graphic display, easy to configure and to commission. Its compact design offers the ideal solution for tight spaces.
