assured, since two shut-off paths independent of each other are always present. Failure of the contactor relays K1 and K2 to drop out is detec- ted – at the latest following resetting of the actuated emergency stop device – by monitoring of the mechanically linked break contacts within the emergency stop safety module K4. Failure of the contactor relay K3 to drop out is detected – at the latest before renewed start-up of the machine movement – through feedback of the mechanically linked break contact to the PLC input I3. Failure of the mains contactor Q1 to drop out is detected by the mirror con- tact read in on the PLC input I3. Welding of this mirror contact is detected by the mechanically linked auxiliary make contact on the PLC input I2. In the event of a fault in the capacitor C1, the measured drop-out time of the contactor relay K3 differs from the time specified in the PLC. The fault is detected and leads to the machine being shut down and to operating inhibition of the machine. Organizational measures ensure that each emergency-stop device is actuated at least once a year.

(BGIA are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. Protective circuits (such as contact protection) as described in the initial paragraphs of Chapter 8 are implemented. • The contactor relays K1, K2 and K3 possess mechanically linked contacts in accordance with IEC 60947-5-1, Annex L. • The pushbuttons S1, S3 and S4 possess direct opening contacts in accordance with IEC 60947-5-1, Annex K. • The contactor Q1 possesses a mirror contact in accordance with IEC 60947-4-1, Annex F. • The standard components K5 and T1 are employed in accordance with the guidance in subclause 6.3.10. • The software (SRASW) is programmed in accordance with the requirements for PL b (downgraded owing to diversity) and the guidance in subclause 6.3.10. • Delayed attainment of standstill by the second shut-off path alone in the event of a fault must not involve an un acceptably high residual risk. • The SRP/CS of the emergency stop safety module K4 satisfies all requirements for Category 3 and PL d. Calculation of the probability of failure Only the probability of failure of the emergency stop function is calculated. • The emergency-stop device S3 is equipped with two break contacts S3.1 and S3.2. The manufacturer states a B of 10D 127,500 cycles for each of the blocks S3.1 and S3.2. With actuation annually and a resulting n of 1 cycle per year, op the MTTF of each contact is 1,275,000 years. The emergency stop safety module K4 is a tested safety component. D Its probability of failure is 3.0 · 10-7 per hour [M], and is added at the end of the calculation. 129 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS The following applies for the probability of failure of the downstream two-channel structure: • MTTF : the PLC K5 has an MTTF of ten years [S]. The frequency inverter has an MTTF of 35 years [M]. The capacitor D D D C1 is included in the calculation with an MTTF of 45,662 years [D]. At a B value of 5,000,000 cycles [M] and a rate D 10D of operations of daily energization on 240 working days, the result is an MTTF of 208,333 years for K1 and K2. At a D B value of 2,000,000 cycles [M] and at 240 working days, 16 working hours and a cycle time of 3 minutes, the n 10D op is 76,800 cycles per year and the MTTF 260 years for K3. At a B value of 600,000 cycles [M] and at 240 working D 10D days, 16 working hours and a cycle time of 3 minutes, the n is 76,800 cycles per year and the MTTF 7.8 years for op D Q1. These values produce a symmetrized MTTF for the channel of 60 years (“high”). D • DC : an adequate test rate of the emergency-stop devices is assured (refer to the information in subclauses 6.2.14 avg and D.2.5.1). Fault detection of the blocks S3.1 and S3.2 is achieved by cross monitoring in K4 (DC = 90%). Fault detection by
