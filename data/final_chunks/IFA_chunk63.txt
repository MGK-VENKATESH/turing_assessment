Further SRP/CS (e.g. safeguards andelectrical logic elements) must be added in the form of subsystems for completion of the safety function. Functional description • Hazardous movements are executed by two actuators, 1A and 2A, in the same hazard zone. The two movements can be stopped either by the two directional control valves 1V5 and 2V1, or at a higher level by the directional con- trol valve 1V3. • Failure of one of these valves alone does not result in loss of the safety function. • 1V5 and 2V1 are actuated cyclically in the process. 1V3 closes only in response to a demand of the safety function, but at least once per shift. 198 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS 1V5 2V1 1V3 1S3 • A technical measure for fault detection is implemented only on 1V3 (position monitoring by 1S3). Certain faults on the unmonitored valves become apparent in the work process. An accumulation of undetected faults may lead to loss of the safety function. Design features • Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. • The directional control valves 1V5 and 2V1 feature a closed centre position with sufficient overlap and spring- centred central position. 1V3 employs electrical position monitoring, since 1V3 is not switched cyclically. • The safety-oriented switch position is attained in each case by removal of the control signal (electrical or hydrau- lic). • A single-channel PLC for example is employed for processing signals from the electrical position monitor. Calculation of the probability of failure • MTTF : an MTTF of 150 years is assumed for the directional control valves 1V3, 1V5 and 2V1 [M]. Capping of the D D second channel (1V3) to 100 years produces a symmetrized MTTF value of 88 years (“high”). D • DC : a DC of 99% for1V3 is based upon the direct monitoring of the switching state by 1S3. The DC of 60% in each avg case for the directional control valves 1V5 and 2V1 is based upon indirect monitoring by the process. Averaging thus produces a DC of 73% (“low”). avg • Adequate measures against common cause failure (65 points): separation (15), overvoltage protection etc. (15) and environmental conditions (25 + 10) • The combination of the hydraulic control elements satisfies Category 3 with a high MTTF (88 years) and low DC D avg (73%). This results in an average probability of dangerous failure of 9.4 · 10-8 per hour. This satisfies PL e. Following the addition of further SRP/CS in the form of subsystems for completion of the safety function, the PL may under certain circumstances be lower. 199 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS Figure 8.53: Determining of the PL by means of SISTEMA 200 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS 201 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS 8.2.28 Position monitoring of movable guards – Category 4 – PL e (Example 28) Open B1 B2 Closed Safeguard 1 Open B3 B4 Closed Enable K1 Safeguard 2 K3 I1.0 I1.1 I1.2 I1.3 I1.4 Inputs K1 PLC Safety module Outputs O1.0 L K2 Q1 K2 Q1 K3 Q2 Q1 Q2 Figure 8.54: Q2 Position monitoring M 3 of movable guards for the prevention Shown in the actuated position of hazardous movements Safety function • Safety-related stop function, initiated by a safeguard: opening of a movable guard (safety guard) initiates the safety function STO (safe torque off). Functional description • A hazard zone is safeguarded by two movable guards (safety guards). Opening of a safety screen is detected by two position switches B1/B2 respectively B3/B4 comprising break contact/make contact combinations and evaluated by a central safety module K1. K1actuates two contactors, Q1 and Q2, dropping out of which interrupts or prevents hazardous movements or states. 202 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS B1 Q1 K1 B2 Q2 K3 K2 • For fault detection purposes, all position switch states are read by a second contact into a standard PLC K3, the chief purpose of which is functional control. In the event of a fault, K3 can de-energize the contactors Q1 and Q2 independently of K1 by means of a contactor relay K2. Faults in K2, Q1 and Q2 are detected by the safety module K1. The safety function is retained in the event of a component failure. The majority of component failures are detected and lead to operating inhibition. An accumulation of undetected faults does not result in loss of the safety func- tion. Design features • Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. Protective circuits (such as contact protection) as described in the initial paragraphs of Chapter 8 are implemented. • A stable arrangement of the guards is assured for actuation of the position switches. • B1 and B3 are position switches with a direct opening contact in accordance with IEC 60947-5-1, Annex K. • The supply conductors to the position
