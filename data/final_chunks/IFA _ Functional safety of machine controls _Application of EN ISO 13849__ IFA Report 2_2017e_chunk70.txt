environmental conditions (25 + 10) • The subsystems B1/B2 and Q1/Q2 each satisfy Category 4 with a high MTTF and high DC (99%). This results in D avg an average probability of dangerous failure of 2.3 · 10–9 per hour for each subsystem. Following addition of the sub- system K1, the average probability of dangerous failure is 4.6 · 10-9 per hour. This satisfies PL e. 227 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS Figure 8.67: Determining of the PL by means of SISTEMA 228 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS 229 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS 8.2.35 Two-hand control – Category 4 – PL e (Example 35) i Changes with respect to the second edition (BGIA Report 2/2008e): The PFH value for the logic unit K1 and the B values for the pushbuttons S1 and S2 were brought into line with more D 10D realistic manufacturers‘ values Enable 13 21 13 21 S1 S2 14 22 14 22 K1 Logic unit Type III C to DIN EN 574 K2 K3 Figure 8.68: Two-hand control, signal processing by a logic device with downstream contactor relays Safety function • Controlled location of the operator‘s hands outside the hazard zone during a hazardous movement: when at least one of the two pushbuttons S1/S2 is released, enabling is cancelled and remains blocked until both pushbuttons are released and pressed again synchronously. Functional description • The logic unit K1 monitors operation of the actuators (pushbuttons) S1 and S2. Only when both pushbuttons are operated synchronously (i.e. within a maximum time of 500 ms as specified in EN 574) from within the released state do the contactor relays K2 and K3 pick up, resulting in enabling. When at least one of the pushbuttons S1/S2 is released, K2/K3 cancel enabling. • K2 and K3 have the function of contact multiplication/load adaptation. The actual prevention of the hazardous movement, for example by separation of the electrical or hydraulic energy, is dependent upon the application and is not shown here. • Faults in the actuating mechanism are detected in S1/S2 to the greatest extent possible by the use of two con- tacts employing different principles (break and make contact combination). In accordance with Recommendation for Use (RfU) CNB/M/11.033/R/E Rev 06, mechanical faults on the actuators can be excluded when they satisfy IEC 60947-5-1. 230 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS S1/13-14 S2/21-22 K2 K1 S2/13-14 S1/21-22 K3 • Faults in S1/S2 and in K2/K3 (with break contacts in the feedback circuit) are detected in K1 and lead to sustained de-energization via K2 and K3. All individual faults are detected at or prior to the next demand of the safety func- tion. • Frequent actuation of the electromechanical elements results in a sufficiently high test rate (forced dynamics). Design features • Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. Protective circuits (such as contact protection), as described in subclause 8.1, are implemented. • The actuators S1 and S2 of the two-hand control satisfy IEC 60947-5-1. In accordance with RfU CNB/M/11.033/R/E Rev 06, mechanical faults can therefore be excluded. • Faults in the conductors to S1 and S2 are detected in the logic device. If this were not possible, the conditions to EN ISO 13849-2, Table D.4 for a fault exclusion for conductor short circuits would have to be observed. Owing to the low currents, pushbuttons with gold-plated contacts are recommended. • Refer to EN 574, subclauses 8 and 9 with regard to fitting of the pushbuttons and measures for the avoidance of accidental actuation and defeating. The safety distance from the hazard zone must be sufficiently great. • The logic unit K1 satisfies Type III C to EN 574, with self-monitoring and detection of internal faults. K1 is a tested safety component for use in Category 4 and PL e. • The contactor relays K2 and K3 possess mechanically linked break contacts in accordance with IEC 60947-5-1, Annex L for feedback. Remarks • The example shown is suitable for application for example on mechanical presses (EN 692). Calculation of the probability of failure • K1 is considered as a subsystem with a probability of failure of 3.0 · 10-9 per hour [M]. The remaining part of the control system is grouped to form a Category 4 subsystem the probability of failure of which is calculated below. • Since S1 and S2 must initiate de-energization independently of each other when released, they are connected logically in series. For this purpose, one make contact 13-14 and one break contact 21-22 were each assigned to a control channel. The safety-related block diagram differs substantially in this respect from the functional circuit diagram. If the reliability data are available only for the pushbuttons as a whole (actuation mechanism and break and make contacts), the failure values for the pushbuttons may be employed as an estimation erring on the safe side for the failure values for the contacts (plus operating mechanism). • MTTF : owing to the defined control current generated by K1 (low electrical load; the mechanical durability of the D contacts is the determining factor), B values of 2,000,000 switching cycles [M] are assumed in each case for 10D S1 and S2. At 240 working days, 8 working hours and a cycle time of 30 seconds, n is 230,400 cycles per year op for these components, and the MTTF is 86.8 years per contact. Since K2 and K3 also switch control currents, D B values of 20,000,000 cycles [S] and resulting MTTF values of 868 years apply to each of them. Should the 10D D re quirements be higher (longer working hours or a shorter cycle time), higher B values validated by the manu- 10D facturer may be required for K2/K3. Overall, the resulting MTTF value per channel is 41 years (“high”).
