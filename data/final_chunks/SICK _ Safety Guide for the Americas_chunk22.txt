Risk reduction Technical protective measures Example: Determining the "actuator" subsystem 1) Definition of the "actuator" subsystem The "actuator" subsystem comprises two contactors with "feedback." As the contactor contacts are positively guided, a safety-relevant failure of the contactors can be detected (EDM). The UE410 logic unit itself is not part of the "actuator" subsystem but is used for diagnostic purposes. 1 1 2) Definition of the category Input Monitoring Single-fault safety (with fault detection) makes the equipment suitable I1 L1 O1 for Category 3 or 4. signal Output signal Note: The category is not defined definitively until the DC value has been specified. 3 3 d d 7028282/2014-09-08 GUIDE FOR SAFE MACHINERY | SICK 3-87 Subject to change without notice ssorC nosirapmoc UE410 Contactors Monitoring Input I2 L2 O2 signal Output signal 3) Determination of the MTTFd per channel s A w s i c tc o h n i t n a g c t f o re rs q u a e re n c s y u ( b n jec ) t m to u s w t e b a e r, u th se e d B t 1 o 0 d c v a a lc lu u e la a te n d th t e h e M e T s T t F im d. a T t h e e d MTTFd = --------- B ----- 1 ---- 0 ----- d ------------ op 0.1 ×n following formula applies: op The figure for the switching frequency comprises operating hours/day [h ], working days/year [d ] as well as the switching frequency per op op B hour [C]: 10d MTTFd = ---------------------------------------------------------------------- General conditions according to the manufacturer: 0.1 ×d ×h ×C op op • B = 2,600,000 10d • C = 1/hour (assumed value) MTTFd Range • d = 220 days/year op Low 3 years ≤ MTTFd < 10 years • h = 16 hours/day op Medium 10 years ≤ MTTFd < 30 years These general conditions result in an MTTFd of 7,386 years per chan- nel, which is interpreted as "high".
