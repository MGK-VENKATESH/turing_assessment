(In practice, presentation of the safety-related control in the form of abstracted blocks and channels is helpful.

It refers to function blocks only in the sense that the General example of a safety-related block diagram; I1 and O1 safety function is executed in smaller units arranged in constitute the first channel (series arrangement), whilst I2, L series and in parallel. The following rules can be stated and O2 constitute the second (series arrangement); the safety for mapping of the hardware structure to a safety-related function is performed redundantly with both channels (parallel arrangement); T is used only for testing block diagram: • The blocks should map, in abstract form, all control II11 OO11 Series arrangement components that relate to performance of the safety SB1 Parallel arrangement function.

Subsystem 2 (SB2) This reflects the fact that should one block fail, perfor- mance of the safety function by the blocks of the other channel is not impaired. In accordance with this definition, the following rules can be formulated for presentation of a safety-related control • Division of the blocks within a channel is somewhat system in the form of a safety-related block diagram: arbitrary; although EN ISO 13849-1 proposes three blocks per channel (input level I, logic level L and output • The arrangement of blocks in series in the form of a level O), this is primarily in the interests of clarity. Nei- “channel” (e.g. blocks I, L and O) expresses the fact ther the precise boundary between I, L and O, nor the that failure of one block may lead to failure of the entire number of blocks in a channel significantly affects the chain. Should for example a hardware unit in a channel probability of failure calculated in the form of the PL. fail dangerously, the entire channel becomes unable to execute the safety function. • The block assignment of each hardware unit relevant to safety must be clearly specified, e.g. in the form of a • A parallel arrangement of blocks or channels symboli- parts list.
