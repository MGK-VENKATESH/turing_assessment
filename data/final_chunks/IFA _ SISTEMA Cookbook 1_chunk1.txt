For this purpose, the safety functions required for risk reduction are defined as part of the risk assessment conducted during design of the machine and then implemented by means of a suitable control system. The safety-related parts of machine controls can be implemented in accordance with EN ISO 13849-1. Included in the requirements of this stan- dard is the necessity The test channel G2- K1-Q1 thus detects faults in B0 and T1/G1 and brings about the safe state; Category 2 is thus met. Note: Reasonable fault detection is also a requirement for Categories 3 and 4. Conversely, Category 2 subsystems lack a redundant functional channel. SISTEMA Cookbook (Version 1.0) - 13 - 3 From the schematic circuit diagram to the safety-related block diagram Step 6a: Adding the test channel of the block The components of the test channel which detect failure of the block and bring about the safe state are presented in the safety-related block diagram as test blocks as shown in Table 1 (Category 2) If components are entered in the test channel, a major basic criterion for Category 2 is met: the safety function must be tested at suitable intervals. This causes the loss of the safety function to be detected and a safe state to be brought about by an independent disconnect- ing device. A further important requirement for Category 2 is the test frequency (see BGIA Report 2/2008e, Section 6.25). However this is not relevant to the structural analysis. Step 7: Is the component "well-tried"? Redundancy or testing was not found in the example. Only Category 1 or Category B are therefore possible. Should the component in the block under analysis be a "well-tried" com- ponent to EN ISO 13849, the block is presented as part of a Category 1 subsystem. A list of well-tried components can be found in EN ISO 13849-2. If not, the block is part of a Category B subsystem. Step 8: Have all blocks been analysed? If further blocks still await analysis following assignment of the block to a subsystem, the pro- cedure on the diagram is repeated with the next block, beginning at Step 2a. The procedure otherwise continues at Step 9. Step 9: Grouping blocks of the same category Subsystems of the same category can be merged by the grouping of components of identical channels (see BGIA Report 2/2008, Figure 6.14). Each component occurs only once within a channel; duplicates can be removed. The same component clearly cannot be used simulta- neously in two redundant functional channels. In Category 2, only components which share the same test channel can be grouped in a functional channel. Since SISTEMA limits MTTF values of each channel within the subsystems (capping), d grouping may result in a lower probability of a dangerous failure per hour being calculated. The lower probability of failure (PFH) is an advantage. A disadvantage however is that the grouped representation often makes it more difficult to follow the logical sequence of signal processing. The examples in Chapter 2 yield the safety-related block diagrams in Figure 5a: Figure 5a: Result of the structural analysis for the examples from Chapter 2 The safety function is now presented logically on the safety-related block diagram. In the next chapter, the probability of failure (PFH) is calculated with the aid of SISTEMA.
