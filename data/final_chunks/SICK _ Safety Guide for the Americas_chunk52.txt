Many of these standards discuss circuit perfor- long as the methodology applied results in levels at least as mance in terms of “control reliability” levels, including single stringent as the approach provided . As always, it is important to channel, single channel with monitoring, dual (redundant) review the industry- or machine-specific standard appropriate channels, and dual channel with monitoring . for the application for further guidance .

Applicable standards • Many North American standards address the system performance in terms of “control reliability .” • ISO 13849-1 uses a risk graph to determine the required safety level . The result of the procedure is a “required performance level” (PLr) . • ISO 13849-1 is also applicable to hydraulic, pneumatic, and mechanical systems . • IEC 62061 uses a numerical procedure . The result is a required safety integrity level (SIL) . 7028282/2014-09-08 GUIDE FOR SAFE MACHINERY | SICK 3-11 Subject to change without notice Technical protective measures Risk reduction § 1 2 3 b 3-12 GUIDE FOR SAFE MACHINERY | SICK 7028282/2014-09-08 Subject to change without notice Risk reduction Safeguarding (technical protective measures) Risk reduction Safeguarding (technical protective measures) Step 3c: Design of the safety function Steps 3c and 3d describe the design nents.
