Safe exhaust and reversing – the dual valve for twice the safety. Standard-compliant safety with minimal response times Series SV dual valves are redundant 3/2 or 5/2 directional valves with direct monitoring that meet requirements to protect against unexpected start-up, as well as safe exhaust (3/2 directional valve) and save reversing (5/2 directional valve) in pneumatic safety controls. The 3/2 dual valves only activate the compressed air supply when all conditions for a safe system start-up have been met, preventing potential accidents. In the event of a machine fault or emergency OFF, the valve exhausts the operating lines, ensuring a de-energized and thus safe state.

To safely monitor the switching state of a valve and hence the safety function performance, an electronic proximity sensor queries the slider position and sends a signal with the switching state to the machine control. The valve is not a safety device but can be used as part of a larger solution. Safety-related features • Correct sensor mounting and positioning, including all tolerances • Tamper-proof: the sensor is protected against tampering • 100% functionally tested before delivery • Can be used in the higher categories 3 and 4, max. possible performance level e • Valve increases the diagnostic coverage of a pneumatic control (99%) • High B value with 39.6 million switching cycles for ISO 1 10 • Implements basic and well-tried safety principles ISO valve Series IS12 Your advantages: • Electrically operated 5/2 directional valve with spring return according to ISO 5599-1, size assess – eliminate The risk assessment process provides the basis for machine safety (see figure on pages 6, 7). The machine manufacturer starts with a risk analysis, minimizes identified risks, and finally determines whether an adequate level of safety is present. If the answer is negative, risk reduction measures must be implemented and quantified in terms of effectiveness. Let’s take a look at some basic terms defined in ISO 12100, which provides a general description of the risk assessment process: Hazards: Potential sources of harm Hazardous situation: Situation in which a person is exposed to at least one hazard. The resulting harm can be immediate or occur over time. Risk: Results from a hazard and is assessed by combining the likelihood of the occurrence of harm and the severity of consequence. c Dangerous c Hot surface electrical voltage c Keep hands clear c Entanglement rotating parts c Risk of entrapment c Cutting hazard c Head injury hazard Basic conditions| Machine safety 5 Towards safe machinery: Risk assessment Globally, and almost without exception, statutory guidelines for the design and operation of machines mandate a risk assessment to identify potential hazards, minimize risks, and comply with applicable health and safety requirements. The process helps determine the type and quality of preventive measures or safeguards.
