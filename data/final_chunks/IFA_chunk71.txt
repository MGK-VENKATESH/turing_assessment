Functional description • Actuation of the two-hand control (THC) S1 and S2 initiates the hazardous movements (processing cycle) of the clamping bar (hydraulic) 1A and of the knife (electromechanical). If, during this cycle, either of the pushbuttons S1 or S2 is released or a signal change occurs in the peripheral system of the machine (e.g. light curtain, not shown on the diagram) that is not expected by the control system, the cycle is stopped and the machine remains in this safe state. Owing to their immediate physical proximity to each other, the knife and the clamping bar constitute a common hazard zone. The hazard occurs cyclically. The knife is driven by an eccentric drive that draws its energy from a flywheel mass in constant motion. The drive is not shown explicitly. The clamping bar is driven linearly by a hydraulic arrangement employing a pump connected to the drive of the flywheel mass. • When pushbuttons S1/S2 (THC) are pushed, the signal change is communicated to the two microcontrollers K1 and K2. Provided these signals satisfy the requirements for simultaneity in accordance with the standard (EN 574, Type III C) and all peripheral signals satisfy the condition for a start, K1 and K2 set the outputs for a valid cut request. Each microcontroller monitors both hazardous movements through the contactor relays K3 to K6. The closing movement of the clamping bar 1A can be prevented by the two hydraulic valves 2V1 and 2V2. Actuation of the brake/clutch combination (BCC) Q1 can be prevented via K3 and K5. A suitably dimensioned mechanical knife locking device Q2 must also be enabled cyclically by K2. Should faults be detected in Q1, the knife cycle can there- fore be prevented in the following cycle at the latest. •Faults in the switches S1/S2 or in the contactor relays with mechanically linked readback contacts K3 to K6 are detected in the microcontrollers by cross monitoring. The functioning of 2V1/2V2 is monitored by means of the pressure switch 2S1. Since the microcontrollers perform self-tests in addition in the background during operation, internal faults and faults in the peripherals can be detected here in time. • All machine states are monitored and controlled by both microcontrollers. The cyclical nature of the cut operation causes all system states to be cycled through and compared with each other. Faults and deviations from defined intermediate states cause the machine to be halted at the latest upon completion of the cycle. This method is implied in the diagram by the signal “Feedback knife” B1 and the signal “Position monitoring” B2/B3 of the
