Opening of guard 1 is detected by two position switches B1/B2 employing a break contact/make contact combination, and evaluated in a central safety module K2. The latter can interrupt or prevent hazardous movements or states in the same way as K1. Guard 2 is monitored by a type 2 position switch with the contacts B3.1 and B3.2 and a safety module K3, also acting upon Q1 and T1. • The safety function is retained in the event of a component failure. • The majority of component failures are detected and lead to operating inhibition. The position switches B1 and B2 on guard 1 are monitored for plausibility in the associated safety module. The safety module also employs internal diagnostics measures. • The electrical contacts B3.1 and B3.2 are monitored for plausibility in the associated safety module K3. This also employs internal diagnostics measures. • Faults in the contactor Q1 are detected by means of mirror contacts and their readback in K2 and K3. Additionalreadback in K1 is not necessary, since a demand for the emergency stop function is much less frequent. A part of the faults in T1 are detected by the process. A small number of faults are not detected by the controller. • Organizational measures ensure that the emergency-stop device is actuated at least once a year. Design features • Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. Protective circuits (such as contact protection) as described in the initial paragraphs of Chapter 8 are implemented. • A stable arrangement of the guards is assured for actuation of the position switches. • The emergency stop device S1 with the direct opening contacts S1.1 and S1.2 satisfies EN ISO 13850. • The contacts of the position switches B2 and B3 have direct opening action in accordance with IEC 60947-5-1, Annex K. • The supply conductors to the position switches B1, B2 and B3 are laid separately or with protection. • The contactor Q1 possesses mirror contacts in accordance with IEC 60947-4-1, Annex F. 157 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS • The safety modules K1, K2 and K3 satisfy all requirements for Category 4 and PL e. • The frequency inverter T1 has no integral safety function. Remarks • The emergency stop function is a complementary protective measure to EN ISO 12100 [3]. Calculation of the probability of failure • Each of the three safety functions can be presented in three subsystems. The safety-related block diagram shows the safety-related stop function by way of example for one of the safeguards, since only one guard is opened at any given time. A comparable safety function with a virtually identical calculation of the probability of failure applies to the second guard. Reasoning must be provided for fault exclusion forbreakage of the actuator of the position switch B3. The probability of failure of the subsystems is calculated as follows. • S1 is a standard emergency stop device to EN ISO 13850. A B value of 100,000 switching cycles for each contact 10D can be substituted for emergency stop devices, irrespective of the load [S]. Three actuations per year is assumed for n . In consideration of the total switching operations of Q1 caused by actuation of the safeguards, this value is op not applied during further analysis of the two safety functions. • MTTF (guard 1, loading): switch B1 is a position switch with make contact. The B is 1 · 105 switching cycles [M]. D 10D For the position switch B2 with direct opening action and roller actuation, the B is 20 · 106 switching cycles [M]. 10D At 220 working days, 16 working hours per day and a cycle time of 10 minutes, n is 21,120 cycles per year for op these components, and the MTTF is 47.3 years for B1 and 9,469 years for B2. D For the contactor Q1, the B value corresponds under inductive load (AC 3) to an electrical durability of 1,000,000 10 switching cycles [M]. If 50% of failures are assumed to be dangerous, the B value is produced by doubling of the 10D B value. Since Q1 is involved in both safety-related stop functions, double the value assumed above for n yields 10 op an MTTF of 473 years. The MTTF for the frequency inverter T1 is 20 years [M]. Altogether, the symmetrized MTTF
