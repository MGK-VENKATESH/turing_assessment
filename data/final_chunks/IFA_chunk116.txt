Further examples of determining of the • Drive 35 PL can be found in Annex A. r • Drive 47 Figure 5.9: Figure 5.8: Risk graph for determining the PL for each safety function r Emergency stop of the entire machine, worst case Required · Low Performance · risk Level PL r · P a Emergency-stop device 01 Drive 21 1 F 1 · Emergency-stop device 02 · Starting S 1 P 2 P 1 b · Emergency-stop device 03 Logic Drive 35 point for F 2 P 1 P 2 c Emergency-stop · device 04 · · · e o r s e f t d t i h m u e c a t r t i i i o s o n k n S 2 F F 2 1 P 2 P 1 d · P e · Drive 47 2 · High · risk · 3 The r (required) suffix indicates that the Performance Level in this case is that required for the safety function (desired value). Validation at a later stage examines whether the PL attained by the actual control system (actual value) is greater than or equal to the PL. In this context, “greater than” means: PL = e > PL = d > PL = c > PL = b > PL = a 32 5 Safety functions and their contribution to risk reduction From the starting-point, the following risk parameters are considered for the duration of the hazardexposure in rela- evaluated4: tion to the overall time for which a machine is in use. • S – severity of injury For a manually charged metalworking press whose ope- rator must reach cyclically between the dies of the press, • F – frequency of and/or duration of exposure to hazard F2 is clearly the appropriate choice.
