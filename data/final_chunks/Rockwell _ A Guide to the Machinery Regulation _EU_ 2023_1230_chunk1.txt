A GUIDE TO THE MACHINERY REGULATION (EU) 2023/1230 Key changes and challenges As the “go to” document for machine builders, the European machinery directive lays out the minimum safety requirements for machinery. The last change to the directive was on 29 December 2009, when 2006/42/EC was introduced. In 2020, as part of the commission work program ‘A Europe fit for the Digital Age’, the Machinery Directive underwent an impact assessment, and it was concluded that a number of gaps required addressing – namely (i) tackling new risks originating from emerging technologies; (ii) legal uncertainty on scope definitions; The Machinery (iii) insufficient provisions for high-risk machines; (iv) adoption of digital documentation; and (vi) divergences in transposition Regulation (EU) interpretation. As the implementation date draws closer, it is important for OEM/ 2023/12301 machine builders to understand the key changes and challenges. What is the impact on OEMs? For OEMs exporting or selling equipment in the EU this will replace the Machinery Directive 2006/42/EC. It highlights: • A new compliance route • A revised structure to the annexes to improve the flow • A dditional requirements added into the essential health and safety requirements • Digital documentation • Cybersecurity requirements 1 https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2023/1230/oj The Machinery Key Dates Re-ordering of Substantial Compliance Route/ OEM - Call to Action Further 2 Regulation (EU) PG 3 the annexes Modifications Fines & Penalties PG 11 Information PG 2 PG 4 PG 9 PG 10 PG 12 MACHINERY REGULATION (EU) 2023/1230 TIMELINE Key dates 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 The new Machinery Regulation (EU) 2023/1230 was published in the official journal on 29 June 2023, JUNE 2023 JULY 2025 JULY 2026 20 JANUARY 2027 and entered into force on 19 July Publication of Regulation Member States must First report by the member Application of Regulation 2023, with a 42-month systems with fully or partially self-evolving behaviour with similar physical characteristics. using machine learning approaches ensuring safety functions that have not been 8.
