with Category 3, PL d and a PFH of 1.5 · 10-10 per hour. D • The safety-related stop function and the safely limited speed are engineered as a continuous Category 3 subsys- tem comprising B1.1/B1.2, G2/G1 and K1 to K4, which is combined with T1 to form an encapsulated Category 3 sub- system. For the first subsystem, a medium MTTF per channel of 14.5 years and a medium DC of 91% yield a PFH D avg D of 7.1 · 10-7 per hour. Combination with T1 (PFH = 1.5 · 10-10 per hour) yields a PFH of 7.1 · 10-7 per hour for both safety D D functions. This satisfies PL d. • Inching mode is implemented by a combination of the Category 2 subsystem S1 (PFH = 5.3 · 10-7 per hour) with D the two Category 3 subsystems comprising T1 (PFH = 1.5 · 10-10 per hour) and G2/G1 together with K1 to K4. With D a medium MTTF per channel of 14.5 years and a medium DC of 91%, the second Category 3 subsystem attains D avg a PFH of 7.1 · 10-7 per hour. Combination of the three subsystems yields a PFH of 1.2 · 10-6 per hour. This satisfies D D PL c.

Further safety-related parts of control systems (e.g. safeguards and electrical logic elements) must be added in the form of subsystems for completion of the safety function. 192 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS 1V1 2V1 2V2 2V3 2S1 Functional description • Hazardous movements are controlled redundantly by directional control valves. Movements can be halted either by the directional control valve 1V1 or by the directional control valves 2V2 and 2V3. The latter are driven by the control valve 2V1. • Failure of one of these valves alone does not result in loss of the safety function. • All directional control valves are actuated cyclically in the process. • The functioning of the control valve 2V1 is monitored by means of a pressure switch 2S1. Certainfaults on the unmonitored valves become apparent in the work process. The valves 2V2 and 2V3 should be equipped with posi- tion monitors, or – since this is not yet state of the art – they should be checked regularly for correct operation. An accumulation of undetected faults can lead to loss of the safety function. • Should trapped compressed air pose a further hazard, additional measures are required. Design features • Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. • The directional control valve 1V1 features a closed centre position with sufficient overlap and spring-centred central position. • The stop valves 2V2 and 2V3 are ideally screwed into the cylinder and driven by the valve 2V1 acting as a pilot valve. • The safety-oriented switching position is assumed from any position by cancellation of the control signal. • A single-channel PLC for example is employed for the processing of signals from the pressure monitor 2S1. Calculation of the probability of failure • MTTF : B values of 20,000,000 cycles [S] are assumed for the valves 1V1, 2V1, 2V2 and 2V3. At 240 working days, D 10D 16 working hours and a cycle time of 20 seconds, n is 691,200 cycles per year. The MTTF for 1V1, 2V1, 2V2 and 2V3 op D is thus 289 years. Capping of the two channels to 100 years results in a symmetrized MTTF value per channel of D 98 years (“high”). • DC : pressure monitoring of the control signal for the stop valves results in a DC of 99% for 2V1. Fault detection via avg the process results in a DC of 60% for 1V1, and regular checking of operation in a DC of 60% for 2V2/2V3. Averaging thus produces a DC of 69.8% (“low”).avg • Adequate measures against common cause failure (85 points): separation (15), diversity (20), overvoltage protec- tion etc. (15) and environmental conditions (25 + 10) The combination of the pneumatic control elements satisfies Category 3 with a high MTTF (98.2 years) and low DC D avg (69.8%). This results in an average probability of dangerous failure of 8.5 · 10-8 per hour. This satisfies PL e. Following the addition of further safety-related control components in the form of subsystems for completion of the safety func- tion, the PL may under certain circumstances be lower. 193 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS More detailed references • VDMA technical rule
