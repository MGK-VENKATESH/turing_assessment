Actions under pressure to keep the machine in operation whatever happens • Actions by certain groups of people (e.g., children, youths, the disabled) Expected malfunctions and faults There is significant potential for hazards due to malfunctions and faults in the components relevant to functional‐ ity, in particular components of control systems. Examples: • Reversing of a roller movement (with the result that hands are drawn in) • Movement of a robot outside its programmed working area Identification of hazards After defining the function of the machine comes the most important step in the risk assessment on the machine. This step comprises the systematic identification of foreseeable hazards, hazardous situations, and/or hazardous events.

This is determined by: The exposure of a person/persons to the hazard ° The occurrence of the hazardous event ° The technical and human possibilities for the prevention or limitation of harm ° There are a variety of tools available for assessing risks, e.g., tables, risk graphs, numerical methods. Based on the results of the risk estimation, the risk assessment determines whether the application of protective measures is required and when the necessary risk reduction has been achieved. NOTE - Tools and tables: Technical Report – ISO/TR 14121-2 Scalable Risk Analysis and Evaluation Method (SCRAM) The method is used to evaluate the initial risk and to estimate the risk after applying inherently safe design measures. It also assists with estimating the effectiveness of the implemented technical protection measures and/or the information for use. This method, developed by SICK on the basis of ISO 12100, has proven itself over many years through its practicality, plausibility, and reliability in preventing errors. All 3 levels of risk reduction (3-step method) are considered by SCRAM: • Safe design • Technical protective measures • Information for use 24 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 1 – RISK ASSESSMENT table 3 and table 5 on the following pages provide the basic framework for SCRAM. table 3 makes it possible to consider both the extent of the damage and the probability of occurrence of that damage. The risk elements used in SCRAM include: • the severity of the injury • the exposure of the person to the hazard • the possibility of avoiding the hazard • the probability of occurrence of the hazard Table 3: SCRAM, Step 1 (main table for determining the risk index) Occurence Severity Exposure Avoidance O1 – O3 O1 O2 O3 E0 ÷ < 1 S1 E1 – E3 A1, A2 < 1 < 1 < 1 E0 ÷ ≤ 1 A1 < 1 < 1 1 E1 A2 < 1 1 1 S2 A1 1 2 2 E2 A2 1 2 2 A1 2 3 3 E3 A2 2 3 3 E0 ÷ 1 A1 3 4 4 E1 A2 3 4 4 S3 A1 4 5 5 E2 A2 5 5 5 A1 5 6 6 E3 A2 6 6 6 E0 ÷ 1 A1 6 7 7 E1 A2 7 7 7 S4 A1 7 8 8 E2 A2 8 8 8 A1 8 9 9 E3 A2 9 10 10 Risk index S Severity of injury: negligible (1), mild (2), severe (3), critical (4) E Hazard exposure prevented (0), low (1), medium (2), high (3) A Possibility of avoidance: avoidable (1), not avoidable (2) O Probability of occurrence: low (1), medium (2), high (3) For all risk elements, this method provides parameters derived from practical experience to make classification easier and to improve the quality of the estimate. The result is a so-called risk index. This is mapped to the safety levels of ISO 13849-1 (PL) and IEC 62061 (SIL) (see table 4, page 26). A separate risk estimation in accordance with ISO 13849-1, Annex A is not required when using SCRAM. 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 25 Subject to change without notice Table 4: Correspondence of the SCRAM risk index to the required safety level Risk index < 1 1 2 – 3 4 – 7 8 – 10
