The resulting (replacement planned by 65A/548/FDIS, 2009-12) movement may for example be comprised of five discrete movements: three translational movements [4] IEC 61508-5 Functional safety of electrical/electro- in the axes X, Y, Z, one swivel movement B and one nic/programmable electronic safety-related systems 1 1 1 1 rotational movement S (see Figure 2, discrete hazard – Part 5: Examples of methods for the determina- 3 E2). tion of safety integrity levels, 1998-12 (replacement planned by IEC 65A/552/FDIS, 2009-12) 2. Movements of a single multi-axis robot must be grouped in a safety function for analysis (multiple [5] Apfeld, R.; Bömer, T.; Hauke, M.; Huelke, M.; robots side by side are considered separately).

Multiple chucks that together hold an item (where a pp. 34-37 failure of one of the chucks results in the item no lon- ger being held) must be grouped in a safety function. With reference to Example 1, formulation of safety func- tions from the discrete analysis can result in the analysis of the hazards presented by the drive axes as shown in Figure 2. The image shows, by way of example, four discrete hazards E1 to E4, marked by red circles, in the machining zoneof a machine tool: E1: Rotational (S) and translational (C, for off-centre 1 1 machining) movement of the left-hand workpiece spindle E2: Rotational (S), translational (X, Y, Z) and swivel (B) 3 1 1 1 1 movement of the milling spindle E3: Rotational (S ) and translational (Z ) movement of the 2 4 right-hand workpiece spindle E4: Rotational (S ) and translational (X , Z ) movement 4 2 2 of a tool spindle (the turret toolholder is indexed;
