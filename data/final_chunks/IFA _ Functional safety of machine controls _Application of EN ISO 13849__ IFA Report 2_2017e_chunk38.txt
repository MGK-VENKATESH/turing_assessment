of EN ISO 13849-1 and IEC 62061 ted discussion among experts. The protracted discussions during the design of safety-related machine controls had resulted in the project being at least two years behind exists, although it has received little attention. As a sector its original schedule. The working group was already standard of IEC 61508, IEC 62061 naturally describes the aware of the essential need to consider backward compa- aspect of “management of functional safety” very expli- tibility to EN ISO 13849-1 and IEC 62061. Straightforward citly. Development and verification of embedded software application of the new standard and retention of existing to EN ISO 13849-1 is based upon the essential require- methods were explicit objectives. The question whether ments for safety-related software that are currently stan- a new standard would have met these objectives and dard practice and are also described in IEC 61508. Broad whether it would have been able to replace the existing agreement exists however that requirements from the standards cannot be answered. In October 2015, two standards should not be mixed. The ISO/TR 23849 ISO/TC 199 took the decision to abandon the work on a guidance document [14] was developed by members of joint standard and year, then at a resulting n of 742 cycles per year, Q1 has an MTTF of 35,040 years. This is also the op D MTTF for the channel, which is capped to 100 years (“high”). D • DC and measures against common cause failures are not relevant in Category 1. avg • The electromechanical control system satisfies Category 1 with a high MTTF (100 years). This results in an average D probability of dangerous failure of 1.1 · 10-6 per hour. This satisfies PL c.

Functional description • Hazardous movements or states are interrupted upon actuation of the emergency stop device S1 by undervoltage release of the supply disconnecting device, in this case in the form of a motor starter Q1. • The safety function cannot be maintained with all component failures, and is dependent upon the reliability of the components. • No measures for fault detection are implemented. Design features • Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. Protective circuits (such as contact protection) as described in the initial paragraphs of Chapter 8 are implemented. The closed-circuit current principle of the undervoltage release is employed as the basic safety principle. • The emergency stop device S1 is a switch with positive mode of actuation in accordance with IEC 60947-5-5, and is therefore a well-tried component in accordance with Table D.3 of EN ISO 13849-2. • The motor starter Q1 is to be considered equivalent to a circuit breaker in accordance with Table D.3 of EN ISO 13849-2. Q1 may therefore be regarded as a well-tried component. • The power supply to the entire machine is switched off (stop Category 0 to IEC 60204-1). Remarks • The function for stopping in an emergency is a protective measure that complements the safety functions for the safeguarding of hazard zones. 120 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS S1 Q1 Calculation of the probability of failure • MTTF : S1 is a standard emergency stop device according to EN ISO 13850. It is manufactured in accordance with D IEC 60947-5-5. In accordance with EN ISO 13849-1, Table C.1, a B value of 100,000 switching cycles may be 10D applied in this case for emergency stop devices, irrespective of the load [S]. For the undervoltage release of the motor starter Q1, the B value approximates to the electrical durability of 10,000 switching cycles [M]. On the 10 assumption that 50% of failures are dangerous, the B value is produced by doubling of the B value. At actua- 10D 10 tion of the emergency stop device twelve times a year and a resulting n of 12 cycles per year, Q1 has an MTTF of op D 16,666 years. This is also the MTTF for the channel, which is capped to 100 years (“high”). D • DC and measures against common cause failures are not relevant in Category 1. avg • The electromechanical control system satisfies Category 1 with a high MTTF (100 years). This results in an average D probability of dangerous failure of 1.1 · 10-6 per hour. This satisfies PL c.
