and environmental conditions (25 + 10) • For Category 4, the average probability of dangerous failure is 6.5 · 10-8 per hour. This satisfies PL e. • With allowance for the estimation erring on the safe side described above, a value of over 17 years (T ) is pro- 10D duced for the specified replacement of the wearing elements S1 and S2. 238 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS More detailed references • EN 1010-3: Safety of machinery – Safety requirements for the design and construction of printing and paper conver- ting machines – Part 3: Cutting machines (2002) + A1 (2009) • EN 574: Safety of machinery – Two-hand control devices – Functional aspects – Principles for design (1996) +A1 (2008) • IEC 60947-5-1: Low-voltage switchgear and controlgear – Part 5-1: Control circuit devices and switching elements – Electromechanical control circuit devices (2009) + A1 (2012).

Further SRP/CS (e.g. safeguards and electrical logic elements) must be added in the form of subsystems for completion of the safety function. Functional description • Hazardous movements are executed by four actuators, 1A to 4A. The movements are halted by the directional con- trol valve 1V3 in conjunction with the pilot-operated non-return valves. Both the former and the latter constitute well-tried components for safety applications. • Failure of the directional control valve or one of the pilot-operated non-return valves can result in loss of the safety function. The failure is dependent upon the reliability of the valves. • No measures for fault detection are implemented. 240 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS 1V3 1V4 1V5 2V1 2V2 3V1 3V2 4V1 4V2 Design features • Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. • 1V3 is a directional control valve with sufficient overlap, spring-centred central position and fatigue-resistant springs. • The valves 1V4, 1V5, 2V1, 2V2, 3V1, 3V2, 4V1 and 4V2 are pilot-operated non-return valves. • The safety-oriented switching position is attained by cancellation of the control signal. • Where necessary, the manufacturer/user must confirm that the directional control valve and the pilot-operated non-return valves constitute well-tried components for safety applications. • The following specific measures are implemented to increase the reliability of the valves: a pressure filter 1Z3 upstream of the directional control valve, and suitable measures on the cylinder to prevent dirt from being drawn in by the piston rod (e.g. an effective wiper on the piston rods, see * in Figure 8.72). Calculation of the probability of failure • MTTF : an MTTF of 600 years is assumed [S] in each case for the directional control valve and the pilot-operated D D non-return valves, since the number of switching cycles of the valves lies between 250,000 and 500,000 per year (n ) for this application. op • DC and measures against common cause failures are not relevant in Category 1. avg • The hydraulic part of the control system satisfies Category 1 with a high MTTF (66.7 years). This results in an ave- D rage probability of dangerous failure of 1.7 · 10-6 per hour. This satisfies PL c.
