B2, the B is 1,000,000 switching cycles [M]. At 365 working days, 16 wor- 10D king hours per day and a cycle time of 10 minutes, n is 35,040 cycles per year for these components, and the op MTTF is 5,707 years for B1 and 285 for B2. An MTTF of 150 years [M] is assumed for each of the valves 1V3, 1V4 and D D 1V5. This yields an MTTF value per channel of 100 and 88 years (“high”) respectively for the two subsystems.

This results in an average probabilities of dangerous failure of 1.3 · 10-9 per hour and 2.1 · 10-8 per avg hour. Addition inclusive of K2 produces an average probability of dangerous failure for the complete safety function of 2.5 · 10-8 per hour. This satisfies PL e.

Functional description • A hazard zone is safeguarded by a movable guard (safety guard). Opening of the safety guard is detected by two position switches B1/B2 employing a break contact element/make contact element combination, and evaluated in a central safety module K1. K1 actuates two contactors, Q1 and Q2, dropping out of which interrupts or prevents hazardous movements or states. • The position switches are monitored for plausibility in K1 for the purpose of fault detection. Faults in Q1 and Q2 are detected by a start-up test in K1. A start command is successful only if Q1 and Q2 had previously dropped out. Start- up testing by opening and closing of the guard is not required. 226 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS B1 Q1 K1 B2 Q2 • The safety function remains intact in the event of a component failure. Faults are detected during operation or at actuation (opening and closing) of the guard by the dropping out of Q1 and Q2 and operating inhibition. • An accumulation of more than two faults in the period between two successive actuations can lead to loss of the safety function. Design features • Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. Protective circuits (such as contact protection) as described in the initial paragraphs of chapter 8 are implemented. • A stable arrangement of the guards is assured for actuation of the position switches. • The switch B1 is a position switch with direct opening action in accordance with IEC 60947-5-1, Annex K. • The supply conductors to position switches B1 and B2 are laid separately or with protection. • The safety module K1 satisfies all requirements for Category 4 and PL e. • The contactors Q1 and Q2 possess mirror contacts in accordance with IEC 60947-4-1, Annex F. Remarks • Category 4 is not observed if several mechanical position switches for different guards are cascaded (connected in a series arrangement), since this limits fault detection in the switches (see Annex E). Calculation of the probability of failure • The circuit arrangement can be divided into three subsystems as shown in the safety-related block diagram. The probability of failure of the standard safety module K1 is added at the end of the calculation (2.3 · 10-9 per hour [M], suitable for PL e). For the remaining subsystems, the probability of failure is calculated as follows. • MTTF : for the position switch B1 with roller actuation, the B is 20 · 106 operation cycles [M]. For the position D 10D switch B2 (make contact element), the B is 1 · 105 operation cycles [M]. At 365 working days, 16 working hours 10D per day and a cycle time of 1 hour, n for these components is 5,840 cycles per year and the MTTF is 1,674 years op D for B1 and B2. For the contactors Q1 and Q2, the B value corresponds under inductive load (AC 3) to an electrical 10 dura bility of 1,000,000 operation cycles [M]. On the assumption that 50% of failures are dangerous, the B value 10D is produced by doubling of the B value. The value assumed above for n results in an MTTF of 3,424 years per 10 op D channel for Q1 and Q2. The position switch B2 exhibits a limited operation time of 17.1 years. Its replacement in good time is recommended. • DC : the DC of 99% for B1 and B2 is based upon plausibility monitoring of the break/make contact element combi- avg nations in K1. The DC of 99% for contactors Q1 and Q2 is derived from regular monitoring by K1 during start-up. The DC values stated correspond to the DC for the subsystem concerned. avg • Adequate measures against common cause failure in the subsystems B1/B2 and Q1/Q2 (70 points): separation (15), well-tried components (5), protection against overvoltage etc. (15) and
