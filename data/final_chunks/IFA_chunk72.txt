“Knife locking device” Q2. • Brake wear is monitored with the aid of the position switch B1. B1 is actuated and a further cut prevented by the control system in response to the slightest increase in the overrun. Design features • Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. Protective circuits as described in the initial paragraphs of Chapter 8 are implemented. • The actuators S1 and S2 of the two-hand control satisfy IEC 60947-5-1. 237 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS • B1 and B2 are position switches with direct opening action to IEC 60947-5-1, Annex K. • K3 to K6 possess mechanically linked contact elements to IEC 60947-5-1, Annex L. • The supply conductors to the position switches are laid either separately or with protection against mechanical damage. • The software of the homogeneously redundant microprocessor structure satisfies the requirements of IEC 61508-3, clause 7 for SIL 3. • A fault exclusion applies for thefault: “complete failure of the brake/clutch combination”, i.e. failure to disengage when the cut enable is cancelled following initiation of a cut. The reasoning for this fault exclusion is based upon many years of experience and the design features of the brake/clutch combination with the possibility of early detection of brake wear. • The components B1 and B2/B3 are required for implementation of the measures required in EN 1010-3 for stopping and overrun of the knife. Calculation of the probability of failure • The designated architecture for Category 4 for actuation of the knife drive and the clamping bar is implemented by two independent channels as described. Since the channels are virtually identical in their arrangement and are analysed with the use of identical numerical data, symmetrization is not required. For the sake of simplification, only single-channel actuation of Q1 is assumed. The probability of failure is therefore slightly lower in practice than that calculated. • Since S1 and S2 must initiate de-energization independently of each other when released, they are connected logically in series. For this purpose, one make-contact 13-14 and one break-contact 21-22 were each assigned to a control channel. The safety-related block diagram differs substantially in this respect from the functional circuit diagram. The B value for each individual contact is employed, constituting an estimation erring on the safe side. 10D • MTTF : at 240 working days, 8 working hours and a cycle time of 60 seconds, n is 115,200 switching cycles per D op year. Owing to many years‘ experience gained in the construction of these machines, together with relevant quality records and design measures such as the defined control current (low electrical load; the mechanical durability of the contacts is the determining factor), B values of 2,000,000 switching cycles [E] each are assumed forS1 and 10D for S2, and thus an MTTF of 173 years. An MTTF of 878 years [D] is stated for the microcontrollers including peri- D D pherals, in accordance with SN 29500-2. At low load, a B of 20,000,000 switching cycles [S] and thus an MTTF 10D D of 1,736 years applies for the contactor relays K3 to K6. The MTTF value of 607 years for the brake/clutch combi- D nation Q1 is calculated from the B value of 7,000,000 cycles [E]. The same value is assumed for the knife locking 10D device Q2 in the second channel. The values for the two directional control valves 2V1 and 2V2 are 150 years [S]. These values result in an MTTF one of each channel of 45.2 years (“high”). D • DC : the DC of 99% for S1/S2 is based upon the cross monitoring of input signals without dynamic test, with fre- avg quent signal changes. The DC of 90% for K1/K2 is derived from self-tests performed by software and the dynamic cross monitoring of data with expectations regarding timing. The DC of 99% for K3 to K6 is derived from plausibility testing by means of mechanically linked contacts. For 2V1/2V2, the DC is 99% owing to indirect and direct electrical monitoring of the pressure with frequent signal changes. Wear in the clutch leads to a change in cutting behaviour. This behaviour is monitored by instruments. A DC of 99% is therefore assumed for Q1. Failure of Q2 is detected immediately owing to cyclical actuation and the monitoring elements B1 and B3. This is the reasoning for a DC of 99%. These values result in a DC of 98.5% (within the tolerance for “high”). avg • Adequate measures against common cause failure (65 points): separation (15), overvoltage protection etc. (15)and environmental conditions (25 + 10) • For Category 4, the average probability of dangerous failure is 6.5 · 10-8 per hour. This satisfies PL e. • With allowance for the estimation erring on the safe side described above, a value of over 17 years (T ) is pro- 10D duced for the specified replacement of the wearing elements S1 and S2. 238 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS More detailed references • EN 1010-3: Safety of machinery – Safety requirements for the design and construction of printing and paper conver- ting machines – Part 3: Cutting machines (2002) + A1 (2009) • EN 574: Safety of machinery – Two-hand control devices – Functional aspects – Principles for design (1996) +A1 (2008) • IEC 60947-5-1: Low-voltage switchgear and controlgear – Part 5-1: Control circuit devices and switching elements – Electromechanical control circuit devices (2009) + A1 (2012).
