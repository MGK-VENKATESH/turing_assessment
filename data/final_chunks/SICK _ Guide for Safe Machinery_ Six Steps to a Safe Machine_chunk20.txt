This knowledge and practical experience is available to you in SICK's service and training portfolio (see "How SICK supports you", page 161). The SISTEMA software assistant, which was developed by IFA in Germany and is available free of charge, supports an effective method for calculating performance level. SICK offers a library of certified safety products for this purpose. 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 143 Subject to change without notice 3D – VERIFYING THE SAFETY FUNCTION Figure 118: Library of certified safety products from SICK in the SISTEMA software tool for determining the performance level NOTE The SICK component library for SISTEMA can be found online under Project Planning Software Library for func‐ tional safety. Summary: Verifying the safety function General • Verify that the intended safety functions conform to the required safety level. To do this, verify mechanical and functional safety. Methods • Determine the resulting level of safety as per ISO 13849-1 (PL). Available methods: Simplified method (based on PL) ° Detailed method (based on PFH values) ° D • If neither the PL nor the PFH value of the subsystem (e.g., the power control element) is known, determine D the safety level of the subsystem from the following aspects: “structure, reliability, diagnostics, resistance, and process”. • Alternatively, determine the resulting level of safety as per IEC 62061 (SIL). Here too it is possible to determine even the safety level of a subsystem that is not certified.

Unlike verification, where only the correct implementation of a solution in accordance with specification is assessed, validation is about the ultimate assessment of a solution in general terms with regard to its suitability to reduce risk as required.

Validation shall show that safety-related parts of the control function meet the requirements of ISO 13849-2, in particular the requirements for the level of safety defined. Insofar as is reasonable, validation should be carried out by persons who were not involved in the design of the safety-related parts of the control systems. In the validation process, it is important to check errors and in particular omissions in the formulated specification. The critical part of how a safety-related control function has been designed is
