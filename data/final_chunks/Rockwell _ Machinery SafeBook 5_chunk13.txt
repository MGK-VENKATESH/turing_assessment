Monitor all status indicator LEDs for proper operation, and monitor the 440C-CR30 safety relay for proper status by using Connected Components Workbench software. 131 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery 4 Press and release the Reset button on the 440C-CR30 safety relay. The SOF 1 output on the 440C-CR30 relay must energize. Monitor all status indicator LEDs for proper operation, and monitor the 440C-CR30 safety relay for proper status by using Connected Components Workbench software. 5 Press the external Start button. The machine must start to run. Monitor all status indicator LEDs for proper operation, and monitor the 440C-CR30 safety relay for proper status by using Connected Components Workbench software. This step is optional in the following SensaGuard validation tests (Steps 6 through 27). 6 With the guarded door closed, connect OSSD 1 to 24V DC. After approximately 40 seconds, the SensaGuard switch trips. The 440C-CR30 safety relay trips. The red Fault status indicator LED on the 440C-CR30 safety relay must blink. The status indicator on the SensaGuard switch fl ashes red. Monitor all status indicator LEDs for proper operation, and monitor the 440C-CR30 safety relay for proper status by using Connected Components Workbench software. 7 Disconnect OSSD 1 from 24V DC. Neither the SensaGuard switch nor the 440C-CR30 safety relay respond. Press and release the Restart button on the 440C-CR30 safety relay. Neither the SensaGuard switch nor the 440C-CR30 safety relay respond. Monitor all status indicator LEDs for proper operation, and monitor the 440C-CR30 safety relay for proper status by using Connected Components Workbench software. 8 Cycle power to the SensaGuard switch. Approximately fi ve seconds after power is restored to the SensaGuard switch, its status LED turns steady green. The blinking red Fault status indicator LED on the 440C-CR30 safety relay turns OFF. Monitor all status indicator LEDs for proper operation, and monitor the 440C-CR30 safety relay for proper status by using Connected Components Workbench software. 9 Press and release the Reset button on the 440C-CR30 safety relay. Monitor all status indicator LEDs for proper operation, and monitor the 440C-CR30 safety relay for proper status by using Connected Components Workbench software. 10 Connect OSSD 1 to DC COM. The 440C-CR30 safety relay trips immediately. The red Safe Stop stack light turns ON. The amber Gate 1 stack light turns ON.
