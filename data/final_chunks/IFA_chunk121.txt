Although The life cycle of the SRP/CS begins with specification of EN ISO 13849-1 contains no explicit provision to this the safety functions. Besides particular aspects of various effect, the concept of the life cycle must also be taken up safety functions, EN ISO 13849-1 also lists general aspects during design and integration of one or more SRP/CSs, that are a minimum requirement in such a specification. in order for the activities to be structured appropriately.
