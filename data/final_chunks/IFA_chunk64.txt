switches are laid separately or with protection. • Faults in the actuating and operating mechanism are detected by the use of two position switches differing in the principle of their actuation (break and make contact combination). • Several safeguards may be cascaded. Cascading limits the facility for K1 to detect faults (see Annex E). The position switches are however additionally monitored by K3; this results in faults being detected even where safeguards are cascaded. • The safety module K1 satisfies all requirements for Category 4 and PL e. • TheFurther information can be found in subclause 6.2.14 4.3 Verification and validation of the control and Annex E. system for each safety function The final parameter, that of the CCF (common cause fai- If the design has already reached an advanced stage by lure, subclause 6.2.15), is similarly easy to calculate: for the time that the achieved PL is determined, the question this parameter, it is assumed that a cause, such as con- arises as to whether this PL is sufficient for each safety 21 4 Report and standard: an overview function executed by the control system.

These process systematically assures that all functional and concern not only SISTEMA itself (the SISTEMA libraries, performance requirements placed upon the safety-related use of network libraries, “Running several instances parts of the control system have beencontactor relay K2 possesses mechanically linked contact elements in accordance with IEC 60947-5-1, Annex L. • The contactors Q1 and Q2 possess mirror contacts in accordance with IEC 60947-4-1, Annex F. • The PLC K3 satisfies the normative requirements set out in subclause 6.3. Calculation of the probability of failure • The circuit arrangement can be divided into three subsystems as shown in the safety-related block diagram. The probability of failure of the safety module K1 is added at the end of the calculation (2.3 · 10-9 per hour [M], suitable for PL e). For the remaining subsystems, the probability of failure is calculated as follows. Since each guard door (guard) forms part of a dedicated safety function, calculation is shown here by way of example for safeguard 1. • MTTF : for the position switch B1 with direct opening action and roller actuation, the B is 20 · 106 switching cycles D 10D [M]. For position switch B2 (make contact), the B is 1 · 105 switching cycles [M]. At 365 working days, 16 working 10D hours per day and a cycle time of 1 hour, the n for these components is 5,840 cycles per year. The MTTF of B1 and op D B2 is 34,246 years and 171 years for B2 respectively. For the contactors Q1 and Q2, the B value corresponds under 10 inductive load (AC 3) to an electrical durability of 1,000,000 switching cycles [M]. On the assumption that 50% of failures are dangerous, the B value is produced by doubling of the B value. The value assumed above for 10D 10 n results in an MTTF of 3,424 years per channel for Q1 and Q2. Altogether, the symmetrized MTTF value per op D D 203 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS channel in the two subsystemsis 100 years (“high”). The position switch B2 exhibits a limited operation time of 17.1 years. Its replacement in good time is recommended. • DC : the DC of 99% for B1 and B2 is based upon plausibility monitoring of the break/make contact combinations avg in K1 and K3. The DC of 99% for the contactors Q1 and Q2 is derived from monitoring at each energization of K1. The DC values stated correspond to the DC of the subsystem concerned. avg • Adequate measures against common cause failure in the subsystems B1/B2 and Q1/Q2 (70 points): separation (15), well-tried components (5), protection against overvoltage etc. (15) and environmental conditions (25 + 10) The subsystems B1/B2 and Q1/Q2 each correspond to Category 4 with a high MTTF (100 years) and high DC D avg (99%). This results in an average probability of dangerous failure in each case of 2.3 · 10-9 per hour. Following addi- tion of the subsystem K1, the average probability of dangerous failure is 4.6 · 10-9 per hour. This satisfies PL e.
