Required protective field size/height of the ESPE As a general rule, the following faults must be excluded when assembling protective devices: • It shall only be possible to reach the hazardous point through the protective field. • In particular, it shall not be possible to reach hazardous points by reaching over/under/around. • If it is possible to stand behind protective devices, additional measures to prevent an unexpected startup are required (e.g., restart interlock, secondary protective device). Once the minimum distance between protective field and the nearest hazardous point has been calculated, the protective field height required must be determined in a further step. This ensures the hazardous point cannot be reached by reaching over. 102 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION Table 39: Examples of correct assembly of ESPE Table 40: Examples of dangerous assembly faults Standing behind Reaching under from a Reaching through Reaching over crouched position Take the possibility of reaching over into account If there is a possibility of reaching over the vertical protective field of an ESPE, the height b of the top edge of the protective field shall be increased or the supplement C adjusted.

Manufacturers shall take account of the safety integration already during the design phase. In practice, this means that the designer shall perform a risk assessment already at the design phase of the machine. The resulting measures shall be incorporated directly into development. Steps 1 to 5 of this guide describe in detail how to proceed here. Preparing technical documents The machine manufacturer shall prepare a technical files according to Annex VII of the Machinery Directive. The technical files are subject to the following criteria: 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 13 Subject to change without notice § – LAWS, DIRECTIVES, STANDARDS • It shall contain all diagrams, calculations, test reports and documents that are relevant to the conformity with the essential health and safety requirements of the Machinery Directive. • It shall be archived for at least ten years from the last day of manufacture of the machine (or the machine type). • Shall be submitted to the authorities on duly reasoned request. NOTE It is not possible to derive from the Machinery Directive an obligation on the manufacturer to supply the complete technical documentation to the purchaser (user) of the machine. Issuing the declaration of conformity After the machine manufacturer has built his machine according to the requirements of the Machinery Directive, he shall declare, in a legally binding manner, conformity with these requirements by issuing a declaration of conformity and marking the machine (CE marking). It is then permitted to place the machine on the market in the European Union. The Machinery Directive explains the process for the conformity assessment. There are two procedures for machinery (see "EU conformity assessment procedure for machinery and safety components", page 16): • Standard procedure: Machines that are not explicitly listed in Annex IV of the 400 350 300 300 300 300 300 250 150 100 0 2 400 550 550 550 500 450 450 400 400 300 250 100 0 2 200 800 750 750 700 650 650 600 550 400 250 0 0 2 000 950 950 850 850 800 750 700 550 400 0 0 0 1 800 1 100 1 100 950 950 850 800 750 550 0 0 0 0 1 600 1 150 1 150 1 100 1 000 900 850 750 450 0 0 0 0 1 400 1 200 1 200 1 100 1 000 900 850 650
