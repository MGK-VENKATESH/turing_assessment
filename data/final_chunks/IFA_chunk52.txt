an electromechanical guard locking device with fail-safe locking element. Fault exclusion can be assumed for the mechanical components of the guard locking device, including mechanical failure of the locking element and the actuator, when the following conditions are met: – Use in accordance with the operating manual, in particular the installation instructions and technical data (e.g. actuating radius, actuating velocity) – Prevention of working loose – The static forces on the guard locking device are lower than the locking force stated on the data sheet – No dynamic forces arise, since current flows through the unlocking solenoid only when the guard door is closed; refer in this context also to DGUV Informative publication 203-079 concerning the selection and fitting of inter- locking devices – The device is not used asa mechanical stop – The actuator is mounted such that it cannot be removed – Regular maintenance is performed – Positive coupling following fitting – Adequate mechanical strength of all mounting and functional elements – Dropping of the door does not lead to the actuator being used outside the range specified by the manufacturer – Damage that could be caused by foreseeable external influences (such as the ingress of dirt or dust; mechanical shock) is prevented by the form of mounting or need not be anticipated under the given conditions of use • B2.1 and B2.2 are switching elements of the guard locking device with direct opening contacts in accordance with IEC 60947-5-1, Annex K. The manufacturer states a B value for the purposes of calculation. 10D • B3 is a direct opening contact in accordance with IEC 60947-5-1, Annex K, and has the purpose of monitoring the door position. • K4 and K5 possess mechanically linked contacts to IEC 60947-5-1, Annex L. • The safety modules K1 and K2 detect cross-circuits and shorts to earth, and satisfy the requirements of Category 4, PL d of EN ISO 13849-1. • The stationary state monitor consists of the sin/cos encoder B4 and the standstill monitor K7. Both satisfy the requirements of Category 4 and PL e. 165 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS Calculation of the probability of failure • Fault exclusion can be assumed for the mechanism of the guard locking device B1. Note: On guard locking devices with fail-safe locking element, fault exclusion is possible only in accordance with the manufacturer‘s information. • The manufacturer states a B value of 3,000,000 cycles [M] each for the switching elements B2.1 and B2.2. At 10D actuation once every 10 minutes, n is 17,520 cycles per year and the MTTF is 1,712 years.op D • The contactor relays K4 and K5 have a B value of 1,000,000 cycles [M]. At actuation once every 10 minutes, n is 10D op 17,520 cycles per year and the MTTF is 570 years. D • The manufacturer states a PFH of 3.0 · 10-9 per hour [M] for the safety module K2. D • DC : the DC of 99% for the contacts B2.1 and B2.2 is attributable to direct monitoring in K2. The DC of 99% for K4 avg and K5 is attributable to direct monitoring in K2 by means of mechanically linked contacts. Averaging results in a DC of 99% (“high”). avg • Adequate measures against common cause failure (70 points): separation (15), FMEA (5), overvoltage protection etc. (15) and environmental conditions (25 + 10) • For the safety function “access to a hazardous movement is prevented by means of a guard door with guard locking”, the average probability of dangerous failure PFH is 5.2 · 10-8 per hour. This satisfies PL e. However, since D the position switch (B2) for monitoring of the locking element and the associated actuating mechanism is present only once, the PL is limited to d. • For the safety function “release of guard locking: opening of the guard is possible only once the motor has come to a halt”, the probability of failure is determined only by the sin/cos encoder B4 and the standstill monitor K7. According to the manufacturer‘s information, the PFH for the sin/cos encoder B4 is 1.2 · 10-8 per hour. A PFH of D D 2.0 · 10-8 per hour is stated for the standstill monitor K7 [M]. The PFH of this safety function is 3.2 · 10-8 per hour. More detailed reference • DGUV Informative publication 203-079: Auswahl und Anbringung von Verriegelungseinrichtungen 203-079(12/2015).

Functional description • The hazardous movement is interrupted redundantly if either the stop button S1 or the protective device K3 – shown in the circuit diagram as electro-sensitive protective equipment (ESPE) – is activated. The drive is halted in an emergency following actuation of the emergency stop device S4. In all three cases, stopping is initiated via the output O3 of
