In particular for metal-working presses, the following applies: Table 37: Supplements for the minimum distances of ESPE on presses according to ISO 16092-1 and ISO 16092-3 Calculation of the supplement for presses Resolution d (mm) of the ESPE Supplement C (mm) Stroke initiation by ESPE/PSDI mode d ≤ 14 0 Allowed 14 < d ≤ 20 80 20 < d ≤ 30 130 30 < d ≤ 40 240 Not allowed > 40 850 NOTE - Press standards: ISO 16092-1, ISO 16092-3 (type-C standards) 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 97 Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION Special case 2: ESPE for presence detection This type of protection is recommended for large sys‐ tems that are accessible from the floor. In this special case, starting of the machine (“preventing start” safety function) must be prevented while there is an opera‐ tor inside. This is a secondary protective device which detects the presence of persons in the hazardous area and simultaneously prevents the machine switching to the dangerous state. In addition to the ESPE for presence detection, there shall be a primary protective measure for the “initiating a stop” safety function, e.g., in the form of another ESPE or a locked, movable physi‐ cal guard. The minimum distance shall be calculated in this case for the main protective device (e.g., a vertical light cur‐ tain that has the task of stopping the machine). Figure 79: Safety laser scanner on a machining center as safety function pos. 1, initiating a stop and safety function pos. 2, preventing start (presence detection) Special case 3: ESPE applications on autonomous vehicles If the dangerous state is as a result of a collision with an autonomous vehicle, the determination of the mini‐ mum distance is generally based only on the speed the vehicle is traveling and not on the approach speed of the person. It is assumed that the person recognizes the approaching vehicle (vehicle with protective device) and stops or moves away. Figure 80: Hazardous area protection on an autonomous vehicle with safety laser scanners The minimum distance needs to be set to a length that is sufficient to stop the vehicle safely. The minimum distance corresponds to the braking distance of the vehicle. An exact calculation of the braking distance is not possible, as it depends on several factors, e.g., friction between the tire and ground, total weight incl. load, braking force, etc. It is therefore recommended to first calculate the minimum distance and validate (confirm) the result by testing. 98 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION For the calculation, the braking deceleration of the vehicle (a) at nominal load, maximum operating speed (v ) 0 and under the intended operating conditions must be known or determined. The braking distance (S ) is then B calculated as follows: 2 v0 S = B 2a Safety supplements may be necessary depending on the application and the technology used. The calculated value must be validated by two tests: 1. For detecting a lying person A test body with a diameter of 200 mm and a length of 600 mm must be used. The test body is placed horizontally in a fixed position on the left, in the middle, and on the right of the vehicle path to be protected and orthogonal (perpendicular) to the vehicle path. Figure 81: Positioning of a test body on an autonomous vehi‐ cle for testing the detection of a person lying down 2. For detecting a standing person A test body with a diameter of 70 mm and a length of 400 mm must be used. The test body is placed vertically and completely in a fixed position anywhere on the vehicle path to be protected.

Validation The vehicle must be loaded with the nominal load and approach the test body at the maximum operating speed. The vehicle must stop in time, therefore either not touch the test body or, if contact occurs,
