This is also the MTTF value per D D D channel, which is capped to 100 years (“high”). • DC and measures against common cause failures are not relevant in Category 1. avg • The hydraulic control satisfies Category 1 with a high MTTF (100 years). This results in an average probability of D dangerous failure of 1.1 · 10-6 per hour. This satisfies PL c. Following the addition of further safety-related parts of the control system in the form of subsystems for completion of the safety function, the PL may under certain circumstances be lower.

Functional description • Stopping of the motor is initiated by actuation of the Off button S1. The motor contactor Q1 drops out and the bra- king function is initiated. The motor is braked by a direct current, which is generated in the braking device K1 by a phase-angle control with thyristors, generating a braking torque in the motor winding. • The stopping time must not exceed a maximum value (e.g. 10 seconds). The level of braking current required for this purpose can be set by means of a potentiometer on the braking device. • After expiration of the maximum braking time, the thyristor is no longer activated and the current path for the braking current is interrupted. The stopping process corresponds to a stop of Category 1 in accordance with IEC 60204-1. • The safety function cannot be maintained with all component failures, and dependents upon the reliability of the components. • No measures for fault detection are implemented. 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS S1 Q1 K1 Design features • Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. Protective circuits (such as contact protection) as described in the initial paragraphs of Chapter 8 are implemented. The de-energi- zation principle (closed current principle) is applied as a basic safety principle. For protection against unexpected start-up after restoration of the power supply, the control system is provided with a latching. • S1 is a pushbutton with direct opening action to IEC 60947-5-1, Annex K. S1 is therefore considered as a well-tried component. • Contactor Q1 is a well-tried component in consideration of the additional conditions in accordance with Table D.3 of EN ISO 13849-2. • The braking device K1 is constructed entirely from simple electronic components such as transistors, capacitors, diodes resistors and thyristors. The safety-related behaviour is determined by the selection of the components. Internal measures for fault detection are not implemented. Application • On woodworking machines or comparable machines on which unbraked stopping would result in an impermissibly long run-down of the hazardous tool movements. The control of the braking function on woodworking machines must be designed such that at least PL b is achieved (prEN ISO 19085-1:2014). Calculation of the probability of failure • The pushbutton S1 and the contactor Q1 are combined for the calculation in SISTEMA to a subsystem that meets the requirements of Category 1. The braking device K1 forms a separate subsystem in Category B. • S1 is a pushbutton with direct opening action according to IEC 60947-5-1, Annex K. • MTTF : A B value of 20 · 106 switching cycles [M] is specified for the pushbutton S1. B value of 1,300,000 swit- D 10D 10D ching cycles [S] at nominal load is assumed for the contactor Q1. At 300 working days, 8 working hours and a cycle time of 2 minutes, n is 72,000 cycles per year. The MTTF is 2,777 years for the pushbutton S1 and 180 years for op D Q1. Together, this results to an MTTF of 169 years, which in accordance with the standard is reduced to 100 years D (“high”) for the subsystem. The contactor Q1 has a limited operation time (T ) of 18 years. Its replacement in good 10D time is recommended. The MTTF for the braking device K1 was determined using the parts count method. The com- D ponent information from the parts list and the values from the SN 29500 database [48] yield an MTTF of 518 years D [D]. This is also reduced to 100 years (“high”). • DC and measures against common cause failures are not relevant in Category B and Category 1. avg • The subsystem S1/Q1 satisfies Category 1 with a high MTTF (100 years). This results in an average probability of D dangerous failure of 1.1 · 10-6 per hour. This satisfies PL c. • The subsystem K1 satisfies Category B with a high MTTF (100 years). This results in an average probability of D dangerous failure of 4.2 · 10-6 per hour. This satisfies PL b. • For the safety-related stop function, the resulting average probability of dangerous failure is 5.4 · 10-6 per hour. This satisfies PL b. 113 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS Figure 8.10: Determining of the PL by means of SISTEMA 114 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS 115 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS 8.2.5 Position monitoring of movable guards – Category 1 – PL c (Example 5) L + Open B1 Q1 Closed M Q1 3~ Figure 8.11: Position monitoring of movable guard for the prevention of hazardous movements (STO – safe torque off) Safety function • Safety-related stop function, initiated by a guard: opening of the movable guard initiates the safety function STO (safe torque off). Functional description • Opening of the movable guard (e.g. safety guard) is detected by a position switch B1 with direct opening contact, which
