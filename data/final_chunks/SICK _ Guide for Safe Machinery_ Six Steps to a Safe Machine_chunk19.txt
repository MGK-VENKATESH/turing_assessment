the following measures: • Cutting off the power supply to induce a safe status • Measures to manage the effects of errors and other effects arising out of a shared data communication process, including transmission errors, repeats, loss, insertion, incorrect sequence, corruption, delay, etc. Determining the level of safety for a subsystem as per IEC 62061 IEC 62061 also supports the determination of the safety level of subsystems created by interconnecting individual components. erutcurtS ytilibaileR scitsongaiD ecnatsiseR ssecorP 3D – VERIFYING THE SAFETY FUNCTION SIL Safety integrity level HFT PFH DC/SFF CCF Check D Figure 116: Aspects for determining the safety integrity level of a subsystem The safety integrity level (SIL) achieved for a subsystem is made up of the following parameters: • Hardware fault tolerance (HFT) • PFH value D • Safe failure fraction (SFF) • Common cause failures (CCF) • Software aspects that are relevant to safety • Systematic failures 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 139 Subject to change without notice 3D – VERIFYING THE SAFETY FUNCTION Hardware fault tolerance (HFT) IEC 62061 defines the structure based on subsystem types and hardware fault tolerance (HFT). HFT 0 means that a single failure in the hardware can result in the loss of the safety function (single-channel systems). HFT 1 means that despite a single failure in the hardware, protection is maintained (dual-channel systems).

For each subsystem, a formula exists to describe the mathematical model to calculate the PFH value. The following parameters are included in the calculation: D • Diagnostic coverage • Mission time • Diagnostic test interval • Failure rate of the components (λ ) D • Common cause failure (common cause factor β) HFT = 1 Diagnosis with DC and DC 1 2 λ ×λ ×(DC +DC ) ×T D1 D2 1 2 D PFH = (1 – β)² × D 2 λ ×λ ×(2 – DC – DC ) ×T D1 D2 1 2 P + 2 λ +λ D1 D2 +β× 2 λ +λ PFH ≈β× D1 D2 D 2 Safe failure fraction (DC/SFF) λ DC = 50% DD λ SFF= 75% S λ D 140 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 3D – VERIFYING THE SAFETY FUNCTION λ Safe failure rate S λ Rate of detected dangerous failures DD λ Rate of undetected dangerous failures D In addition to the diagnostic coverage DC ("Diagnostic coverage (DC)", page 134), the “safe failure fraction” (SFF) indicates the proportion of the total failure rate that does not lead to a dangerous failure. ∑λS+∑λDD SFF = ∑λS+∑λD Resistance to common cause failure (CCF) IEC 62061 also requires a range of considerations with regard to resistance to common cause failures. A common cause factor (β) is calculated based on the number of positive permutations.

Result - Determining the SIL for the subsystem First, the safety integrity of the hardware is determined separately for each subsystem: If the subsystems are already developed (as is the case with safety light curtains, for example), the manufacturer of the subsystem will supply the corresponding parameters in the context of the technical specification. A subsys‐ tem of this type is usually described in sufficient detail by the specification of SIL, PFH , and mission time. D For subsystems consisting of subsystem elements (interlocking devices for protective doors or contactors, for example), on the other hand, safety integrity must be determined. SIL claim limit Once the hardware tolerance (architecture) has been specified, the maximum achievable SIL (SIL claim limit) can be determined for the subsystem.

Example: Determining the SIL and PFH of the “power control elements” subsystem D 1) Definition of the “power control elements” subsystem The “power control elements” subsystem comprises two contactors with “feedback”. As the contactors are positively guided, a safety-rel‐ evant failure of the contactors can be detected (EDM). The UE410 logic unit is not itself part of the “power control ele‐ ments” subsystem, but it is used for diagnostics purposes. 2) Definition of hardware fault tolerance (HFT) Subsystem element 1: Single-error safety with error detection results in an HFT of 1. λ D1 ,DC 1 Common cause failure Diagnosis β Subsystem element 2: λ ,DC D2 2 3) Determination of the PFH 1 0,1×C D λ = = a) Based on the fault rate λ D MTTF B D D 10D Since contactors are subject to wear, the B value and the esti‐ 10D mated switching frequency must be used to calculate the switching frequency per hour [C].
