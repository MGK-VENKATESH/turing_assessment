DC of 99% for K2 and K3 is based upon readback of the mechanically linked break contacts in the feedback circuit of K1. The high frequency of actuation in the application results in frequent testing (see sub- clause 6.2.14). Averaging results in a DC of 99% (“high”). avg • Adequate measures against common cause failure (70 points): separation (15), FMEA (5), overvoltage protection etc. (15) and environmental conditions (25 + 10) • The combination of the control elements satisfies Category 4 with a high MTTF per channel (41 years) and high D DC (99%). For the combination of S1, S2, K2 and K3, the average probability of dangerous failure is calculated at avg 6.7 · 10-8 per hour. If a value of 3.0 · 10-9 per hour [E] for K1 is added, the result is an average probability of dange- rous failure of 7.0 · 10-8 per hour. This satisfies PL e. The probability of failure of downstream power components may have to be added for completion of the safety function. • The wearing elements S1 and S2 should each be replaced at intervals of approximately eight years (T ). 10D More detailed references • EN 574: Safety of machinery suitability for application in practice, and subclauses of the standard and of the present report. also consistent precision of when “SRP/CS” refers to the entire control system executing a safety function, and The example circuits in Chapter 8 of the report have been when to a subsystem that executes only a part of the thoroughly updated from the 2008 versions based upon safety function.

Functional description • Actuation of the two-hand control (THC) S1 and S2 initiates the hazardous movements (processing cycle) of the clamping bar (hydraulic) 1A and of the knife (electromechanical). If, during this cycle, either of the pushbuttons S1 or S2 is released or a signal change occurs in the peripheral system of the machine (e.g. light curtain, not shown on the diagram) that is not expected by the control system, the cycle is stopped and the machine remains in this safe state. Owing to their immediate physical proximity to each other, the knife and the clamping bar constitute a common hazard zone. The hazard occurs cyclically. The knife is driven by an eccentric drive that draws its energy from a flywheel mass in constant motion. The drive is not shown explicitly. The clamping bar is driven linearly by a hydraulic arrangement employing a pump connected to the drive of the flywheel mass. • When pushbuttons S1/S2 (THC) are pushed, the signal change is communicated to the two microcontrollers K1 and K2. Provided these signals satisfy the requirements for simultaneity in accordance with the standard (EN 574, Type III C) and all peripheral signals
