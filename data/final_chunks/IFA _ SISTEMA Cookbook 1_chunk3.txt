Cookbook (Version 1.0) - 21 - 4 Transfer to SISTEMA Figure 21 The safety-related parameters of the components can be determined from any of the following: a) Manufacturers' data b) Established collections of data (for sources, see EN ISO 13849-1, Annex D) c) EN ISO 13849-1, Annex C; stored in SISTEMA under "Typical component values" (3.). If all dangerous component faults can be excluded, a fault exclusion can also be selected when "Enter MTTF -value directly" is selected. d 4.6.3.2 DC For Category 2 and higher, fault-detection measures for the components are required. In the block or element (1.), a percentage is entered on the "DC" tab (2.) for each component to describe the diagnostic coverage of fault detection. Selection of "DC-rating by choosing measures" enables the DC tables in EN ISO 13849-1, Annex E to be accessed via "Library" (3.). The values can be accepted as-is or used for guidance.Where the standard proposes a band of possible DC values, a concrete value within this band can be selected (Figure 22). 22.. 11.. 33.. Figure 22 SISTEMA Cookbook (Version 1.0) - 22 - 4 Transfer to SISTEMA 4.7 Objective attained? Check for error messages (red cross) in the message window (centre, below). If none are present, the PFH can be calculated (Figure 23). Figure 23 The result of the calculation is indicated at the bottom left for the selected safety function and the corresponding subsystems, blocks and elements (Figure 24). The (attained) PL of the safety function must at least equal the (required) PL. If the attained PL is insufficient, r components with a higher MTTF or a higher B value must be employed, the fault detection d 10d (DC) must be improved, or subsystems of other Categories must be implemented. Figure 24 SISTEMA Cookbook (Version 1.0) - 23 - Annex A Concepts and abbreviations Annex A: Concepts and abbreviations Definition of key concepts referred to in a similar way in Annex B of EN ISO 13849-1: Concepts Definition Safety function (SF) Safety-oriented response to a triggering event (demand upon the safety function). In redundant systems, the safety function is exe- cuted in multiple and independent ways. The PL describes the reliability of its execution. Schematic circuit dia- Excerpt from the wiring diagram or function circuit diagram which gram indicates the technical (hardware) interconnections between the safety-related parts of the control system. Safety-related block Presentation of the logical connections between the components diagram from which the functional and test channels can be seen. Components Safety-related hardware units, parts of the control system Subsystem (SB) Largest unit of components which executes the safety function fully or in sections. A subsystem possesses a continuous struc- ture and is described by a Category. Encapsulated subsys- Safety component for which the manufacturer already states the tem PL, PFH and Category. The internal structure need not therefore be considered more closely. Functional channel Hardware units connected in series; chains of components which execute the entire safety function from the sensor to the actuator. Redundant subsystems possess (at least) two independent func- tional channels. Function signal Signal that passes the demand for the safety function on along a functional channel from the sensor to the actuator, where for example it leads to disconnection. Redundant function Hardware unit connected in parallel; component in a section of a block redundant functional channel; part of a functional channel in Category 3 or 4 subsystems. Non-redundant functi- Component in a section of a non-redundant functional channel; on block part of a functional channel in Category B, 1 or 2 subsystems. Test channel Chain of components which transmits a "Testing" disconnection signal (not to be confused with the signal path over which test signals are exchanged between the testing and tested blocks for the detection of a dangerous failure). Testing disconnection Transmits the result of a test which has detected a dangerous signal failure of a function block, from a test block to a function block further on or to an additional disconnecting block, with the result that the safety function is successfully completed or a safe state is brought about. Test block Hardware unit for diagnostics: Component that tests one or more function blocks and generates a "Testing" disconnection signal when it detects a dangerous failure in them; or a transmitting or disabling block in the test channel Closed-circuit current Interruption of a circuit leads to the safe state. principle SISTEMA Cookbook (Version 1.0) - 24 - Annex B Abbreviations from EN ISO 13849 1 Annex B: Abbreviations from EN ISO 13849-1 Abbrevia- Unit Name Comment tion SRP/CS - Safety-Related Part of a Control System MTTF Year, a Mean Time To dangerous Failure Component quality d DC % Diagnostic Coverage Test quality (block, ele- ment) DC % Average Diagnostic Coverage Test quality (subsystem) avg CCF - Common Cause Failure Simultaneous failure of redundant channels PFH 1/h Probability of a dangerous Failure Probability of failure per Hour PL - Performance Level Actual value of the func- tional safety PL - Required Performance Level Specified value of the func- r tional safety Cat. - Category T Year, a Mission Time Service life M B Cycles Number of cycles until 10% of the Component quality (wea- 10d components fail dangerously ring component) T Year, a Mean Time until 10% of the com- Permissible operating time 10d ponents fail dangerously (wearing component) n Cycles/a number of operations Operating frequency op (average, per year) SISTEMA Cookbook (Version 1.0) - 25 - Annex C Model form for user's applications Annex C: Model form for user's applications Definition of the safety function: Triggering event: ___________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________ Response: ___________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________ Safe state: ___________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________ Schematic circuit diagram with entries for functional and test channels: In the annex Safety-related block diagram of the first functional channel, where applicable with the addition of components in the second functional channel or in the test channel: Final safety-related block diagram, where applicable following the grouping of subsystems of the same Category: SISTEMA Cookbook (Version 1.0) - 26 - Annex D Schematic table
