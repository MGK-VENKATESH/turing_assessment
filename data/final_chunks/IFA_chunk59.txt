G2 (where relevant for the rotary encoders)and T1 are employed in accordance with the information in subclause 6.3.10. • For the safety functions under analysis, a fault exclusion is assumed for the fault condition of encoder shaft breakage (G1/G2). For details of the possibility of a fault exclusion, refer for example to IEC 61800-5-2, Table D.8/ GS-IFA-M21. Remarks • The circuit example can be employed for implementation of the “safety-related stop function” and “safely limited speed” safety functions in a control system for three-wing and four-wing revolving doors with break-out function (the door wings can be folded manually in an emergency) for use in public and commercial buildings. • Regular manual inspection of the pressure-sensitive edge is required. Firstly, its serviceability must be checked; secondly, the pressure-sensitive edge must be inspected visually in order for any damage to be detected in good time. Calculation of the probability of failure Detailed calculation of the probability of failure is performed for the safety function “safety-related stop function (SS1-r)”, which is also shown in the block diagram: • Since the pressure-sensitive edge with the associated control unit is available commercially as a safety compo- nent, its probability of failure is added at the end of the calculation (3.0 · 10-7 per hour [E]). • The frequency inverter T1 with STO is also available for purchase as a safety component; its probability of failure is added at the end of the calculation (1.5 · 10-8 per hour [M]). The fast stop function T1s is modelled in the first chan- nel of the block diagram. • MTTF : the safety-related components of K1 and K2 and their peripherals are considered, following application of D the parts count method, by a value of 878 years [E]. A value of 190 years [M] is substituted in the formula for G1 and G2. Avalue of 100 years [M] is applied for T1s. A B value of 400,000 cycles [S] is substituted for K3. At one 10D actuation per day, n is 365 cycles per year, and the MTTF is 10,959 years. A B value of 1,000,000 cycles [M] is op D 10D substituted for Q1, resulting in an MTTF of 27,397 years. The brake Q1 is required only in the event of a fault, and is D not subject to operational wear. Overall, the symmetrized MTTF value for the two channels is 82 years (“high”). D • DC : owing to internal self-tests and comparison, the DC for K1 and K2 is 60%. Internal self-tests are performed on avg the microcontroller components. Ramp monitoring yields a DC of 99% for the block T1s. Owing to the comparison performed by way of K1 and K2, G1 and G2 are rated with a DC of 99%. With direct monitoring of a read-back mecha- nically linked contact element, K3 is rated accordingly with a DC of 99%. Owing to performance of the static start- up test, a DC of 30% is substituted for Q1. Averaging thus yields a DC of 95% (“medium”). avg • Adequate measures against common cause failure (70 points): separation (15), FMEA (5), overvoltage protection etc. (15) and environmental conditions (25 + 10) • The combination of the control elements satisfies Category 3 with a high MTTF of each channel (82 years) and D medium DC (95%). This yields an average probability of dangerous failure PFH of 4.3 · 10-8 per hour. Together avg D with the sensor unit B1 (consisting of a pressure-sensitive edge and control unit) and the frequency inverter T1, the overall average probability of dangerous failure of the control for this safety function is 3.6 · 10-7 per hour.This satisfies PL d. 184 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS Calculation of the probability of failure for the “safely limited speed (SLS)” safety function • For this analysis, the sensor unit B1 in the first example analysis is replaced by the light barrier system B2 with a probability of failure of 1.5 · 10-9 per hour [E]. Addition yields an average probability of dangerous failure of the control system for this safety function of 6.0 · 10-8 per hour. The implementation of the safety function SLS satisfies PL d.
