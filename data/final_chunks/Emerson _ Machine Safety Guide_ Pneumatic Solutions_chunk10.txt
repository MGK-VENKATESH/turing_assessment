Within the risk assessment process, we focus on implementing technical measures to mitigate risk, evaluating the safety function, and determining the performance level. The graphic below shows the risk assessment process – this guide uses examples to take you through the individual steps until the performance level is achieved. The performance level (PL) must meet or exceed the required performance level (PL). This depends on factors such as the r control architecture (category), the mean time to dangerous failure
