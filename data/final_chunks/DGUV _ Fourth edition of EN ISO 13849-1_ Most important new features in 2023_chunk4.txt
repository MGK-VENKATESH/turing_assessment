of PL (or SIL), PFH, category (or hardware fault tolerance) and mission time, subsystem elements are usually described in terms of MTTF or λ (device type 2) or B (device D D 10D type 3) in conjunction with their mission time. Further information can be found in the VDMA specification 66413 (universal database) [10]. 18 Conclusion The fourth edition of EN ISO 13849-1 is the result of a thorough overhaul of the standard. A clearer structure has been created on the basis of proven concepts, and further application aids have been added. Although the number of pages has increased substantially as a result, so has its ease of use. The IFA’s known application aids for EN ISO 13849 are gradually being adapted to the changes in the standard and are being made available at www.dguv.de/ifa/13849e. The SISTEMA software wizard will contain all the changes in version 3.0, and the IFA Reports 2/2017 and 4/2018, including the circuit examples, will also gradually be updated to reflect the new version of the standard.

Fourth Edition of EN ISO 13849-1 (July 2023) 1 / 12 Illustration: Major changes to the design process for SRP/CS in the fourth edition of the standard 1 Introduction Regarding the scope of the standard, a new note clarifies that its content is geared towards stationary machinery, although other types of machinery, such as mobile machinery, are also expressly covered. The position of the standard in the iterative process of risk reduction under EN ISO 12100 is now presented in more detail. The informative Annex A of the standard can be used in this context to determine the required performance level (PL) unless it is specified in a product standard (type-C r standard). Unlike the preceding version, this edition of the standard specifies in more detail that it can also be used, for instance, for the integration of logic units and electro-sensitive protective equipment into safety-related parts of control systems (SRP/CS) as well as for the design of subsystems using safety components, such as two-hand control devices, interlocking devices, relays, valves, position sensors and enable switches. The reference to Technical Report ISO/TR 23849 [2] on the application of ISO 13849-1 and IEC 62061 – withdrawn in 2020 – was deleted. That content is now included in the current editions of both standards. Both standards have been harmonised under the Machinery Directive and can be used for the design and integration of safety-related control systems of machinery (including software) (see also below, section 6). Concerning the adoption of validation requirements from part 2 of the standard in section 10, the authors clarify that the more recent requirements from part 1 take priority during the transitional period until the revision of EN ISO 2015 https://www.dguv.de/medien/ifa/en/pra/softwa/sistema/kochbuch/sistema_cookbook6_en.pdf [6] IEC 61131-3: Programmable controllers - Part 3: Programming languages (02.13).

At the same time, it can be assumed that they will be met as soon as the validation requirements from part 2 have been implemented. Fourth Edition of EN ISO 13849-1 (July 2023) 2 / 12 2 Section 1: Scope As in the previous edition, the authors point out that the standard only applies to SRP/CS for a high demand or continuous mode of operation. According to definition 3.1.44, the demand for this mode is more frequent than once a year. For SRP/CS in low demand mode, i.e. where the frequency is less than once a year – for instance in the processing industry – the authors now refer expressly to the IEC 61508 series of standards. IT security aspects are not covered by the standard, but the authors point out that the such aspects can also impact safety functions. For further details, reference is given to ISO/TR 22100-2 [3] and IEC/TR 63074 [4]. 3 Section 3: Terms, definitions, symbols and abbreviated terms The revised standard contains a large number of new definitions, whereas some of the previous definitions have been dropped. Nearly all existing definitions have been renumbered. It should be emphasised, in particular, that the previous “probability of dangerous
