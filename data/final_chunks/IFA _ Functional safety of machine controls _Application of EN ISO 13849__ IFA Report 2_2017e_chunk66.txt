for contact welding. Should Q2 fail to drop out, F1 trips the upstream circuit-breaker or motor starter Q1 via the latter‘s undervoltage release. The circuit-breaker or motor starter then switches off the motor. • The safety function is preserved in the event of a component failure. • An accumulation of faults between two successive actuations can lead to loss of the safety function. 210 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS Q2 K1 F1 Q1 Design features • The circuit-breaker Q1 is checked regularly by means of a test function that is to be implemented manually. The interval between the tests should not exceed one-hundredth of the MTTF of Q1; the test could be performed for D example during maintenance of the machine. The contactor Q2 is tested continually by the contactor monitoring module. Loss of the safety function between the tests, as is possible with Category 2, cannot occur. The single-fault safety is thus assured and the requirements of Category 3 are met. • Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. Protective circuits (such as contact protection) as described in the initial paragraphs of Chapter 8 are implemented. • For reasons of simplification, details of the safeguard have been omitted from the presentation. • The safeguard acts upon a safety module K1 that satisfies all requirements for Category 3 or 4 and PL e. • The auxiliary contacts of the contactor Q2 are mechanically linked in accordance with IEC 60947-5-1, Annex L. • Faults are analysed for Q2 (with mirror contacts) and for the internal relay of the contactor monitoring module F1 as for mechanically linked contacts. Remark • Consideration must be given to the response time caused by the contactor monitoring module F1 with regard to the dropping-out of Q1. Calculation of the probability of failure • The safety function permits division into two subsystems. The subsystem consisting of the safeguard and the safety module K1 is not considered in this example. • MTTF : for the contactor monitoring module F1, the MTTF is 125 years at a maximum n of 350,400 cycles per D D op year [M]. Under inductive load (AC 3), the B value attained for Q1 is 10,000 switching cycles and the B value 10D 10D attained for Q2 1,300,000 switching cycles. With assumed actuation daily on 365 working days, n is 365 cycles op per year for Q1, and the MTTF is 274 years. At 365 working days, 16 working hours and a cycle time of 1 minute, D n is 350,400 cycles per year for Q2, and the MTTF is 37 years. For the channel consisting of F1 and Q1, this results op D in an MTTF of 85 years. Overall, the resulting symmetrized MTTF value per channel is 64 years (“high”). D D • DC : the DC of 99% for Q2 is based upon testing by means of the contactor monitoring module F1. A DC of 99% for avg F1 is achieved by fault-detection measures within the contactor monitoring module. The circuit-breaker Q1 is tested by means of the manual test function that is to be implemented; this produces a DC of 90%. A DC of 99% is substi- tuted for F1. Averaging thus yields a DC of 98% (“medium”). avg • Adequate measures against common cause failure (65 points): separation (15), overvoltage protection etc. (15) and environmental conditions (25 + 10) • The subsystem, comprising Q1, Q2 and F1, satisfies Category 3 with a high MTTF (64 years) and medium DC D avg (98%). This results in an average probability of dangerous failure of 4.4 · 10-8 per hour. This satisfies PL e. Following addition of the subsystem, comprising safeguard and safety module K1, the PL may under certain circumstances be lower. • In consideration of estimation erring on the safe side as described above, a T value of 3.7 years is produced for 10D the wearing element Q2 for replacement as specified. 211 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS Figure 8.59: Determining of the PL by means of SISTEMA 212 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS 213 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS 8.2.31 Pneumatic valve control (subsystem) – Category 4 – PL e (Example 31) Hazardous 1A movement 1S2 G 1V2 G 1S1 1V1 0S1 P 0V1 0Z Figure 8.60 Tested pneumatic valves for redundant control of hazardous movements Safety functions • Safety-related stop function: stopping of the hazardous movement and prevention of unexpected start-up from the rest position, implemented by safety sub-function SDE. • Only the pneumatic part of the control system is shown here, in the form of a subsystem. Further SRP/CS (e.g. safeguards and electrical logic elements) must be added in the form of subsystems for completion of the safety function. 214 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS 1V1 1V2 1S1 1S2 Functional description • A hazardous movement of the cylinder is controlled redundantly by the valves 1V1 and 1V2. The movements can be halted either by the directional control valve 1V1 or 1V2. • Failure of one of these valves alone does not result in loss of the safety function. • Should at least one of the control signals be cancelled, the piston side of the cylinder is vented. • A single valve fault is detected by the integral position monitoring function when the control signal is cancelled; following a fault, initiation of the next hazardous movement is prevented. Design features • Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. • 1V1 and 1V2 are directional control valves with sufficient overlap, spring-return and electrical position monitoring. • Cancellation of the control signals places the valve in the safety-oriented switching position. • Signal processing by the electrical position monitoring function satisfies the relevant requirements for the control of failures. Calculation of the probability of failure • MTTF : a B value of 20,000,000 cycles [M] is assumed for the directional control valves. At 240 working days, D 10D 16 working hours and a cycle time
