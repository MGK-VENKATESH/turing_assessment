The products used are: SensaGuard RFID coded, non-contact safety interlock switch which is connected to a Guardmaster 440C-CR30 confi gurable safety relay. The output devices used are 100S-C safety contactors. The safety rating achieved by this pre-engineered safety function is: CAT. 4, PLe to (EN) ISO 13849-1. The publication number of the original document is: SAFETY-AT133C-EN-P Functional Safety Description Personnel are protected from the hazardous motion by a fi xed barrier. Access to the hazardous area, when necessary, is through a swinging door. The door is monitored by a SensaGuard non-contact interlock, which is connected to inputs of the 440C- CR30 confi gurable safety relay. The 440C-CR30 relay controls two 100S-C safety contactors which, connected in a series, control power to the motor that drives the hazardous motion. Whenever this monitored door is opened, the safety system 110 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Application Examples removes power to the motor. The motor and the hazardous motion it drives coast to a stop (Stop Category 0). The motor cannot be restarted while the monitored door is open. Once the door is closed, the motor can be restarted by pressing and releasing the Reset button to reset the 440C-CR30 relay and then initiating the external Start to restore the motor power that is controlled by the 100S-C contactors. The SensaGuard switch monitors the status (open or closed) of the door. The SensaGuard switch also monitors its two OSSD outputs for faults. The 440C-CR30 relay monitors the inputs from the SensaGuard switch for faults, and it also monitors the status of the Reset and Feedback signals from the 100S-C contactors. The relay monitors its own outputs for faults as well. These outputs control the 100S-C contactors. The 440C-CR30 relay turns off its outputs and removes power to the motor when a fault is detected. It does not reset until that fault is corrected. Bill of Material This application uses these products.

Hazardous motion is ceased or prevented whenever this door is not closed. In addition to monitoring the state of the guarded door, the SensaGuard switch monitors its outputs for all fault conditions. The 440C-CR30 confi gurable safety relay also detects an open-wire fault, a single-channel fault, or a short to 0V at its SensaGuard switch inputs. 111 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery The 440C-CR30 confi gurable safety relay monitors the pulse-tested outputs that drive the safety contactor coils for all fault conditions. The proper, safe state of the safety contactors, K1 and K2, is confi rmed by the 440C-CR30 confi gurable safety relay that is monitoring the feedback signals at SMF2 at start-up. 24V DC - Class 2 DC COM 440C-CR30-22BBB A1 A2 Bn Rd Yel 440C- CR30 Access 100S-C23EJ23BC* Door Gy EI_00 EO_18 K1 Pk 440N-Z21U16A EI_01 EO_19 K2 100S-C23EJ23BC* Bu L1L2L3 Feedback 2080-IQ4OB4 K1 External Start P1_00 Stop K2 P1_01 K1 Reset Plug-In I/O K2 P1_02 A3 M 800FP-R611PQ10V B4 B3 *ISO 13849-2 requires transient suppression across the load as a Basic Safety Principal.

A detailed description of each step is beyond the scope of this document. Knowledge of the Connected Components Workbench software is assumed. Confi gure the 440C-CR30 Relay Follow these steps to confi gure the Guardmaster 440C-CR30 relay in Connected Components Workbench software. 1. In Connected Components Workbench software, choose View and then Device Toolbox. When in Device Toolbox, select 440C-CR30-22BBB. 2. In the Project Organizer, double-click Guardmaster_400C_CR30 *. 113 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery 3. To add the plug-in I/O module called for in this circuit, right-click the left plug-in module space and choose the 2080-IQ4OB4 module. TIP: The I/O module is shown in standard gray, because it is not a safety I/O module. That is permissible in this application, because it is not used to connect safety signals. Inputs such as Feedback and Reset button are not considered strict, safety signals. Using the standard I/O for these non-safety signals can reserve the limited number of safety inputs and outputs for true safety signals. 4. Click the Edit Logic button to open the Connected Components Workbench workspace. A blank workspace appears. 114 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Application Examples 5. From the View pull-down menu, choose Toolbox. The Toolbox appears. Confi gure the Inputs The Toolbox does not list a SensaGuard Safety Monitoring Function. Follow these steps to confi gure one. 1.Select Alternative Device. Drag it to the green block in the Safety Monitoring column and release it. 115 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery Connected Components Workbench software automatically assigns the fi rst two available inputs, EI_00 and EI_01, to the device. Leave those as assigned. Connected Components Workbench software automatically assigns the function name SMF 1 to this block. By default, the software assumes an electro-mechanical device and assigns Test Sources. The SensaGuard switch has two OSSD outputs and does not require Test Sources. 2. To properly confi gure the block, open Advanced Settings and select 2 OSSD from the Inputs pull-down menu. The
