Might not be required in certain Hazard zone conditions (e.g., covering of the control switch). This value is not required in some North American standards, but should be included as a best practice when considering minimum distance for a two-hand control device. S If a two-hand control is fitted to a portable stand, then the maintenance of the necessary minimum distance must be ensured by a spacer bar or limited cable lengths (to prevent the operator carrying the control to a place where it will not provide the required safety). 3 Spacer bar c Floor - Calculation of the minimum distance: OSHA 1910.217, ANSI B11.19, RIA TR R15.406, CSA Z432, NR-12, ISO 13855 7028282/2014-09-08 GUIDE FOR SAFE MACHINERY | SICK 3-63 Subject to change without notice Safeguarding (technical protective measures) Risk reduction Application of reset and restart If a protective device has issued a stop command, the stop The signal from the reset device is part of the safety function. § state shall be maintained until a manual reset device is As such, it shall: activated and the machine can subsequently be restarted.
