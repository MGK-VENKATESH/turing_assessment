the other. Calculation of the probability of failure • Since the laser scanner F1 and the safety PLC K1 are available for purchase as safety components, their probabi- lities of failure are added at the end of the calculation (F1: PFH = 8.0 · 10-8 per hour[M], K1: PFH = 2.5 · 10-9 per D D hour [M]). For the hydraulic part of the control system, the probability of failure is calculated as shown below. • MTTF : values of 150 years [M] are assumed for the valves 1V3 to 1V5. Overall, this results in a symmetrized MTTF D D value of 88 years (“high”) for the two channels. • DC : a DC of 99% for 1V4 is produced by direct monitoring in K1 with the aid of the position monitor 1S3. Owing to avg the close coupling of 1V3 and 1V4, this results in 1V3 being monitored indirectly at the same time with a DC of 99%. The DC of 60% for 1V5 is based upon fault detection in the process with cyclical actuation. Averaging thus produces a DC of 86% (“low”). avg • Adequate measures against common cause failure (90 points): separation (15), diversity (20), FMEA (5), overvol- tage protection etc. (15) and environmental conditions (25 + 10) • The combination of the control elements in the hydraulic part satisfies Category 3 with a high MTTF per channel D (88 years) and low DC (86%). This results in an average probability of dangerous failure of 6.2 · 10-8 per hour for avg the hydraulic system. • Altogether, the average probability of dangerous failure PFH is (8.0 + 0.25 + 6.2) · 10-8 per hour = 1.4 · 10-7 per hour.

Functional description • The multi-purpose control (MPC) S1 converts the operator‘s manual movement of it into electronic messages. It sends these messages cyclically over a serial data communications line (bus system) to the logic control. This generates control signals for the hydraulics, which in turn executes the working movements of the earth-moving machine desired by the operator. • The message 1 sent by the MPC S1 reaches the microcontroller K3 via the bus transceiver K1. From message 1 and in accordance with the algorithms stored in the software, K3 generates the analog signals required for actuation of the proportional valve 1V4. The resistances R1/R2 and the measuring amplifiers K6/K8 have the function of cont- rolling the output currents for the proportional valve.
