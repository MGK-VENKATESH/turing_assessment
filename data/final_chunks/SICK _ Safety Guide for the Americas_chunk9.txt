Increase height of top edge The height of the hazard zone a and the supplement deter- S mined by the resolution C are used to calculate the required RT 2 height of the top edge of the protective field b when the C K x T RT minimum distance S remains unchanged.

This is achieved with the determination of the height of the C RO K x T hazard zone a and the height of the top edge of the protective field b. The result of the intersection produced in the table below represents the intrusion distance C . If C ≥ C , the C RO RO RT RO value replaces the C value in the calculation of the minimum RT distance. b a If C < C , the C value shall be used to calculate the mini- RO RT RT mum distance.
