These four discrete hazards thus yield the four safety func- tions SF1 to SF4. The safety function SF1 for E1 for example However, where several actuators (e.g. contactors, valves, comprises one feed axis and one spindle drive (C, S).

Multiple chucks that together hold an item (where a pp. 34-37 failure of one of the chucks results in the item no lon- ger being held) must be grouped in a safety function. With reference to Example 1, formulation of safety func- tions from the discrete analysis can result in the analysis of the hazards presented by the drive axes as shown in Figure 2.
