PL d could be achieved by using two key switches per door, but further action on the monitoring of each switch will be required as well. Note: If the risk assessment had shown that a serious injury, S2, could occur, the outcome would have been PL= e. r This would have meant that the above solution was inadequate. For the emergency stop function, PL d can be achieved provided that certain failure exclusions can be made.
