change without notice Risk reduction Safeguarding (technical protective measures) Safety distance for guards Guards must be at an adequate distance from the hazard zone if they have openings. This requirement also applies to openings between a protective device and a machine frame, jigs, etc. There are different distance requirements depending on the type of opening (slotted, square, circle).

Safety distance for interlocking guards For interlocked movable guards that initiate a stop, a safety S Hazard zone distance must also be observed similar to the procedure for ESPE. Alternatively, interlocks with locking mechanisms may be used to prevent access until the hazard is no longer present see section “Locking devices” - 3-24).

S = (K × T) + C • K is a parameter in millimeters per second, derived from the data for the approach speeds of the body or parts of the body, usually 1600 mm/s. • T is the stopping/run-down time of the overall system in seconds. • C is a safety distance taken from the corresponding table in either ANSI B11.19 and CSA Z432, or ISO 13857 and RIA TR R15.406 (safety distance as a function of opening in guards). This is necessary if it is possible to insert fingers or hands through the opening and towards the hazard zone before a stop signal is generated.  Calculation of the minimum distance for interlocking guards: ANSI B11.19, RIA TR R15.406, ISO 13855 Height requirements for guards Similar to the procedure for ESPE, the same procedure is also to be used for guards. Different calculation tables are to be 3 used depending on the potential hazard. c To prevent crawling beneath guards, it is normally sufficient if the guards start at 180 mm above the reference level (unless a C-Type standards states a more restrictive requirement). 200 mm (max) Parameters for determining the height requirements for guards Required height for guards in case of low risk according to ANSI B11.19, RIA TR R15.406, CSA Z432, and ISO 13857 Height a of the hazard Horizontal distance C to the hazard zone (mm) zone (mm) 2500 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2400 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 0 0 2200 600 600 500 500 400 350 250 0 0 0 2000 1100 900 700 600 500 350 0 0 0 0 1800 1100 1000 900 900 600 0 0 0 0
