The starting-point for these systems is the reception of safety-related input signals, for example detection of the position of a guard door by means of a Type 2 position switch, the separate actuator of which is fitted to the door and itself constitutes a safety-related part. Once received, the signals are processed, leading to generation of an output signal. 25 5 Safety functions and their contribution to risk reduction Figure 5.1: Iterative risk reduction process START Risk assessment carried out Determination of the limits in accordance with ISO 12100 of the machinery (see section 5.3a) yes Hazard identification (see section 5.4a a nd Annex Ba) This iterative risk reduction process shall be carried out Risk estimation separately for each hazard (see section 5.5a) under each condition of use (task).
