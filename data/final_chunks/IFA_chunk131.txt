Should for example a hardware unit in a channel probability of failure calculated in the form of the PL. fail dangerously, the entire channel becomes unable to execute the safety function. • The block assignment of each hardware unit relevant to safety must be clearly specified, e.g. in the form of a • A parallel arrangement of blocks or channels symboli- parts list. This permits calculation of the mean time to zes the multiply redundant performance of the safety dangerous failure (MTTF ) of the block, based upon the function, or of relevant parts of it. For example, a safety D MTTF of the hardware units belonging to the block con- function performed by multiple channels is maintained D cerned (e.g. by failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) provided at least one channel has not suffered failure. or the parts count method, see subclause 6.2.13). • Blocks employed for test purposes only, which do not • Hardware units employed purely for test purposes, impair performance of the safety function in the diffe- failure of which cannot directly impair performance rent channels should they fail, can be presented as a of the safety function in the various channels, may be separate test channel.
