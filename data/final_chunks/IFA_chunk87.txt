These classes are intended to cancel out minor (MTTF ) which corresponds to the reciprocal of the failure differences between the calculated MTTF values, which D D rate, i.e.: in any case become irrelevantis paid to the proportions of risk reduction with and without safety- operating modes requiring manual intervention, e.g. for: related parts of a control system.
