Calculation Hazards must come to a safe state prior to an operator reaching the hazard. For the safety distance calculation, there are two groups of standards. In this chapter, these standards are grouped as follows: ISO EN: (EN ISO 13855) US CAN (ANSI B11.19, ANSI RIA R15.06 and CAN/CSA Z434-03) Formula The minimum safety distance is dependent on the time required to process the Stop command and how far the operator can penetrate the detection zone before detection. The formula used throughout the world has the same form and requirements. The differences are the symbols used to represent the variables and the units of measure. The formulas are: ISO EN: S = K x T + C US CAN: Ds = K x (Ts + Tc + Tr + Tbm) + Dpf Where: Ds and S are the minimum safe distance from the danger zone to the closest detection point Directions of Approach When considering the safety distance calculation where light curtains or an area scanner is used, the angle of approach to the detection device must be taken into consideration. Three types of approaches are considered: Normal - an approach perpendicular to the detection plane Horizontal - an approach parallel to the detection plane Angled - an angled approach to the detection zone. 56 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety Distance Calculation Speed Constant K is a speed constant. The value of the speed constant is dependent on movements of the operator (i.e. hand speeds, walking speeds, and stride lengths). This parameter is based on research data showing that it is reasonable to assume a 1600mm/sec (63in/s) hand speed of an operator while the body is stationary. The circumstances of the actual application must be taken into account. As a general guideline, the approach speed will vary from 1600mm/s (63in/s) to 2500mm/sec (100in/s). The appropriate speed constant must be determined by the risk assessment. Stopping Time T is the overall stopping time of the system. The total time, in seconds, starts from the initiation of the stop signal to the cessation of the hazard. This time can be broken down to its incremental parts (Ts, Tc, Tr and Tbm) for easier analysis. Ts is the worst case stopping time of the machine/equipment. Tc is the worst case stopping time of the control system. Tr is the response time of the safeguarding device, including its interface. Tbm is additional stopping time allowed by the brake monitor before it detects stop-time deterioration beyond the end users’ predetermined limits. Tbm is used with part revolution mechanical presses. Ts + Tc + Tr are usually measured by a stop-time measuring device if the values are unknown. Depth Penetration Factors The Depth Penetration Factors is represented by the symbols C and Dpf. It is the maximum travel towards the hazard before detection by the safeguarding device. Depth penetration factors will change depending on the type of device and application. Check the relevant standard to determine the best depth penetration factor. For a normal approach to a light curtain or area scanner, whose object sensitivity is less than 64mm (2.5in), the ANSI and Canadian standards use: Dpf = 3.4 x (Object Sensitivity - 6.875mm), but not less than zero. For a normal approach to a light curtain or area scanner, whose object sensitivity is less than 40mm (1.57in), the ISO and EN standards use: C = 8 x (Object Sensitivity - 14 mm), but not less than 0 These two formulas have a cross over point at 19.3mm. For object sensitivity less than 19mm, the US CAN approach is more restrictive, as the light curtain or area scanner must be set back further from the hazard. For object sensitivities greater than 19.3mm, the ISO EN standard is more restrictive. Machine builders, who want to build one machine for use throughout the world, must take the worst case conditions from both equations. 57 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery Reach-Through Applications When larger object sensitivities are used, the US CAN and ISO EN standards differ slightly on the depth penetration factor and the object sensitivity. The ISO EN value is 850mm where the US CAN value is 900mm. The standards also differ in the object sensitivity. Reach-Over Applications Both standards agree that the minimum height of the lowest beam should be 300mm, but differ with respect to the minimum height of the highest beam. The ISO EN states 900mm, whereas the US CAN states 1200mm. The value for the highest beam seems to be moot. When considering this to be a reach-through application, the height of the highest beam will have to be much higher to accommodate an operator in a standing position. If the operator can reach over the detection plane, then the reach over criteria applies. Single or Multiple Beams Single or multiple separate beams are further defi ned by the ISO EN standards. The fi gures below shows the “practical” heights of multiple beams above the fl oor. The depth penetration is 850mm for most cases and 1200mm for the single beam usage. In comparison, the US CAN approach takes this into account by the Reach- Through requirements. Getting over, under or around the single and multiple beams must always be taken into consideration. # Beams Height above the fl oor - mm (in) C - mm (in) 1 750 (29.5) 1200 (47.2) 2 400 (5.7), 900 (35.4) 850 (33.4) 3 300 (11.8), 700 (27.5), 1100 (43.3) 850 (33.4) 4 300 (11.8), 600 (23.6), 900 (35.4), 1200 (47.2) 850 (33.4) Distance Calculations For the normal approach to light curtains, the safety distance calculation for the ISO EN and US CAN are close, but differences do exist. For the normal approach to vertical light curtains where the object sensitivity is a maximum of 40mm, the ISO EN approach requires two steps. First, calculate S using 2000 for the speed constant. S = 2000 x T + 8 x (d -1 4) The minimum distance that S can be is 100mm. 58 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK
