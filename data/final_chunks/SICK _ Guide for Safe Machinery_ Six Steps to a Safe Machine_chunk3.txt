the force applied to the (1) horizontal test body must not exceed 750 N and to the (2) vertical test body must not exceed 250 N. This is the current standardized method to be used for the protection of autonomous vehicles in the industrial sector (ISO 3691-4). The method can also be used for the non-industrial sector, but it is important to consider the following: • It cannot always be assumed that persons will never approach the moving vehicle. Both speeds (person and vehicle) may therefore need to be considered accordingly. • The maximum permissible forces in the event of contact with children or elderly people are much lower than those specified. • The bodily dimensions of children cannot be simulated using the specified test bodies. In this case, the dimensions of the test bodies should be taken from the relevant literature. Special case 4: Stationary application of an onboard ESPE The way in which some machines function requires that operators are located very close to the hazardous area. On press brakes, small pieces of plate must be held very close to the bending edge. Moving systems that form a protective field around the tool openings have proven to be practical protective devices. Because the hand approach speed of the operator is not taken into account in such applications, the general formula is not applicable. The requirements to be met by the resolution are very high and reflections on metal surfaces shall be prevented. For this reason, focused laser systems with image-based evaluation are used. This type of protection is defined in the type-C standards in conjunction with other measures (e.g., 3-pedal foot switch, automatic stop time measure‐ ment, requirement to wear gloves, etc.). NOTE - Safety of press brakes: EN 12622 (type-C standard) NOTE Specific know-how and equipment are required to measure the stopping/run-down time and the required minimum distance. SICK offers these measurements as a service. Approaches to calculating the minimum distance Solution approach 1: Perpendicular approach – hazardous point protection with presence detection The calculation results in a minimum distance of S = 320 mm (see figure 83). By using a safety light curtain with the best possible resolution (14 mm), this is already the optimal minimum distance. Two AOPDs are used to ensure that the person is detected everywhere in the hazardous area: • a vertical AOPD positioned according to the calculated minimum distance (vertical approach) - for the safety function: initiating a stop • a horizontal AOPD to eliminate the risk of standing behind - for the safety function: preventing an unexpected start-up 100 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice mm 41 noituloseR S=320 mm H=500 mm b a 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION x = d (resolution of the horizontal AOPD for presence detection) H x= d≤ +50 (or cf. type-C standard) for presence detection 15 x Hazardous area Total stopping/run-down time of the system = 0.16 s S=2,000 × 0.16 + 8 × (14 -14) S=320 mm a = Height of the hazardous area x = End of the protective field to the machine d = Detection capability (resolution of the AOPD) b = Height of the uppermost beam, for determination see “Required H = Installation height protective field size/height of the ESPE” S = Minimum distance Figure 83: Determining the positioning and sizing of ESPE for hazardous point protection and presence detection using a safety light curtain Solution approach 2: Parallel approach – hazardous area protection A horizontal AOPD is used. The following figure shows a horizontally arranged AOPD and the calculation of the minimum distance S. If the installation height of the AOPD is increased to 300 mm, the minimum distance is reduced. For this height, an AOPD with a resolution less than or equal to 80 mm can be used. It must not be possible, however, to access the hazardous area beneath the AOPD (evaluate the risk of crawling beneath). This type of safeguarding is also often implemented using AOPDDR (laser scanners). However, supplements have to be added for these devices for technology-related reasons.

This solution allows the operator to stand between the hazardous area and the AOPD without being detected. For this reason, additional safety measures shall be applied to reduce this risk. The control device (e.g., a reset button) must be positioned so that the entire hazardous area can be overseen. It must not be accessible from the hazardous area. 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 101 Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION S=1,106 mm Hazardous area 1,100 mm 700 mm Total stopping/run-down time of the system = 0.16 s S=1,600 × 0.16 + 850 S=1,106 mm 300 mm Figure 85: Determining the positioning and sizing of ESPE for access protection using a safety multibeam sensor and for a parallel approach Comparison of the results Table 38: Comparison of solution approaches, selection according to operational requirements Solution approach Advantages Disadvantages for stopping/run-down time = 0.16 s 1 Hazardous point protection • Increased productivity, as the oper‐ • Higher price for the protective S = 320 mm
