of the machine, and other factors, the protective field of an ESPE can be reached over to gain access to hazardous points before the hazardous machine functions have ceased and the intended protection is thereby not provided. The figure shows an example comparing an ESPE that cannot be reached over and an ESPE that can be reached over.
