Circuit examples for SRP/CS • The combination of the control elements satisfies Category 2 with a high MTTF (75 years) and low DC (60%). D avg This results in an average probability of dangerous failure of 8.7 · 10-7 per hour. This satisfies PL d. The addition of further SRP/CS in the form of subsystems for completion of the safety function may under certain circumstances result in a lower PL.

Functional description • Studio hoists driven by electric motors are widely used in studio and stage applications. During downward move- ment, the cable may become slack should the load stick or tilt or come to rest on other objects. In such cases, a risk exists for example of the obstruction suddenly giving way, the load slipping, and danger consequently arising for persons in the hazard zone. • Upward and downward movements of the studio hoist can for example be controlled by means of an infrared remote control. This function is not evaluated here; it must, however, always be implemented with consideration for safety. • In order for the studio hoist to be prevented from falling in the event of breakage of one suspension element, the load is borne by two suspension elements. A slack-cable switch B1/B2 with a break-contact element/make-contact element combination is fitted to each suspension element. • The microcontroller K1 evaluates the switching states of the slack-cable switches B1 and B2. Via logic gates K2/K3 and optocoupled transistor amplifiers K16/K17, K1 also controls the contactor relays K19 and K20 for the upward and downward movements of the studio hoist. • The switching states of the contacts of the slack-cable switches B1 and B2 are evaluated by the microcontroller K1 and tested for plausibility. For testing of the inputs used on the microcontroller, forced dynamics is employed on the signals from the slack-cable switch B1. This involves the microcontroller forcing a temporary signal change via the logic gates K5 and K6, in order to ascertain whether the inputs are still able to transmit Report 2/2008e): The changes between the second and third editions of the standard, and its future development, are discussed at • References updated the end of the chapter. • New subclause 4.4 concerning changes arising from 4.1 Identification of safety functions and the third edition of the standard, 2015 their properties • Subclause 4.5 (formerly 4.4) concerning future deve- The design and assessment process begins with a well- lopment of the standard updated tried concept, that of the definition of one or more safety functions (SFs).

The vol- tage monitor K7 monitors the supply voltage generated by means of K22. Faults in the microcontroller are detected by temporal monitoring of the program sequence in the watchdog K8. The components K19 to K21 for control of the studio hoist‘s upward and and downward movements are monitored by means of readback – decoupled by optocouplers K13 to K15 – in the microcontroller. Should a fault be detected, the studio hoist is shut off at a higher level by the component detecting the fault via the contactor relay K21, actuated by logic gate K4 and decoupled by optocoupler K18. If the watchdog K8 is not retriggered in time by the microcontroller K1, the movement of the studio hoist is stopped from K8 via all logic gates K2 to K4. Design features • Basic and well-tried safety
