Your Guide for Machine Safety Pneumatic solutions conform ISO 13849 Reduce safety risks for your employees and improve the productivity of your machinery. Optimized machine safety with Emerson To prevent accidents at work, companies have to protect themselves against safety risks. But meeting required safety standards can present a real challenge. Emerson’s ASCO and AVENTICS products and solutions for fluid control & pneumatics make an important contribution to improving machine safety. We have extensive, long-term experience in designing pneumatic controls. Pneumatics can realize technical safety measures and is critical in industries using machines with horizontal or vertical motions especially. Protecting people, machines, animals, the environment, and property is the top priority, best achieved using safety-related solutions for fluid control and pneumatics. 3 Introduction 31 AV valve system with AES fieldbus system 4 Directives and standards 33 503 Zone Safety Valve system 5 Hazards and risks: 35 Series AS air preparation units Estimate – assess – eliminate 37 Series 652/653 Series Redundant 6 Towards safe machinery: safe exhaust Valve Risk assessment 39 Series SV01/-03/-05 safety valves 8 Risk assessment: Risk analysis 41 Series ISO valve IS12 9 Risk analysis: identifying hazards 43 Series LU6 10 Risk analysis: 45 Analog distance measuring sensors Risk estimation –Performance level 11 Risk assessment: Risk evaluation 47 SISTEMA, the software assistant 13 Implementing a safety function your go-to guide! 49 Product overview with service life ratings 15 Selecting a category 18 Further parameters to determine 59 Glossary performance levels 61 Benefit from our experience 20 DC – diagnostic coverage 21 CCF – common cause failure 22 Further measures to assess robustness 23 Pneumatics range for guaranteed safety 25 Emerson expertise 27 Circuit example: “Safe exhaust” 29 Circuit example: “Safe stop” 2 Machine safety | Introduction Introduction| Machine safety 3 Directives and standards The European Machinery Directive High MTTF MTTF MTTF D n ≥ 3 to < 10 years D m ≥ 10 to < 30 years D h ≥ 30 to < 100 years (resp. < 2.500 years in Cat. 4) low medium high Design and technical implementation of safety function 2A Redundant blocking of cylinder in vertical direction: G 2S • With compressed air failure and in the starting position of valve 2V, the locking unit 2A can reliably stop the cylinder. 1S1 • In the locked position (center position) for valve 1V1, cylinder G movement is impeded by air pressure in the chamber. • The 2V valve can be tested with the 2S sensor.

Basic safety principles include: Well-tried safety principles include: • Use of suitable materials and production • Overdimensioning/safety factor processes • Automatic/form-fit actuation • Correct dimensioning and forming of • Limited electrical/mechanical parameters in all components fluid technology: • Highly resistant components (against various - Secured position (excluding impulse valves) influences) - Use of well-tried springs • Energy isolation (quiescent current principle) - Separation of safety functions from non-safety • Ambient conditions/external protection against functions unexpected startup in fluid technology: - Pressure limitation - Measures to prevent contamination of pressure medium Well-tried components: In addition to the category B requirements, safety-related parts of control systems in category 1 must also be constructed as well-tried components. Well-tried components • Have seen successful large-scale use in the past in similar applications or • Have been manufactured and tested by applying principles that demonstrate suitability and reliability for safety-related applications. Annex B of ISO 13849-2 does not contain a list of well-tried pneumatic components.

Before a final answer about the performance of a safety function can be given, MTTF , DC, and CCF must be defined. D Mean time to dangerous failure (MTTF ) D Assessment MTTF MTTF describes the mean duration in years until a D D Low 3 years ≤ MTTF < 10 years dangerous system component failure. D Medium 10 years ≤ MTTF < 30 years It is a statistical value for electrical/electronic D components, which is identified through trials or High 30 years ≤ MTTF D < 100 years (resp. < 2.500 years in Cat. 4) reliability prognoses based on failure probabilities for the components. c Source: ISO 13849 Formula for determining B MTTF = 10D MTTF D for a mechanical D 0,1 • n element in a channel: op B = B x 2 as recommended by IFA 10D 10 Mean n (actuations/year) op d • h • 3600s/h for the mechanical element: n = op op op t cycle d = day, h = hours, s = second Calculating the total MTTF 1 D for two different channels: 2 1 1 MTTF = MTTF + MTTF - + D 3 DC1 DC2 MTTF MTTF DC1 DC2 For our 2-channel example and taking into account the following operating data, for channel 1 this means: 220 d, 16 h/d, T = 10 s -> n = 1.267.200 cycles/year and a B value for the CD07 5/3 directional valve of 24.8 million switching op 10 cycles results in an MTTF value of 391.41 years; D For channel 2 with the following operating data: 220 d/a, 16 h/d, T = 3.600 s -> n = 3.520 cycles/year and a B value for the CD04 directional valve of 32 million switching cycles as op 10 well as a B value of 2 million switching cycles for the LU6 locking unit results in an MTTF value of 181.818 years for the valve and 10D D 5.682 years for the locking unit. Both channels therefore have a high MTTF value. D 18 Machine safety |
