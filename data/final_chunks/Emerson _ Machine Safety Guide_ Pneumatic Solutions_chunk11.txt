Basic conditions Risk assessment: Risk analysis Risk assessment comprises three areas: risk analysis, risk evaluation, and risk reduction. The actual risk analysis starts with defining the limits of a machine when considering all phases of its lifecycle. Once all hazards have been identified, the risk of each hazard must be estimated. Risk analysis: machine limits In addition to spatial limits and the overall duration of use, operating limits are a prime focus. Proper use is analyzed, including all operating modes and different intervention options, as well as reasonably foreseeable misuse. For risk analysis, it is necessary to consider the entire machine lifecycle, from transport to installation, commissioning and cleaning, disassembly and, finally, disposal.
