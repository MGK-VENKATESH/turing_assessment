Monitor all status indicator LEDs for proper operation, and monitor the 440C-CR30 safety relay for proper status by using Connected Components Workbench software. 31 Press and release the Reset button on the 440C-CR30 safety relay. The red Safe Stop stack light must be OFF. The SOF1 output on the 440C-CR30 safety relay must energize the contactors. Monitor all status indicator LEDs for proper operation, and monitor the 440C-CR30 safety relay for proper status by using Connected Components Workbench software. Validation of Safe Response to Abnormal Operation – The safety system responds properly to all foreseeable faults with corresponding diagnostics. Contactor – 440C-CR30 Confi gurable Safety Relay Tests Test Step Verifi cation Pass/Fail Changes/ Modifi cations 1 While the machine continues to run, break the connection between terminal EO_18 of the 440C-CR30 confi gurable safety relay and the A1 terminal of the K1 coil. The hazardous motion must coast to a stop. 2 Press the external Stop button. Restore the connection. Press the external Start button to resume the hazardous motion. 3 While the hazardous motion continues to run, connect the A1 terminal of the K1 coil to 24V DC. After approximately 18 seconds, the 440C-CR30 safety relay must trip. K2 must de-energize. The hazardous motion coasts to a stop. The red Fault status indicator LED on the 440C-CR30 safety relay is ON. 4 Disconnect the A1 terminal of the K1 coil from 24V DC. Press and release the Reset button on the 440C-CR30 safety relay. The 440C-CR30 safety relay must not respond. 5 Cycle power to the 440C-CR30 safety relay. It responds. The 440C-CR30 safety relay Fault status indicator LED is OFF. 6 Press and release the Reset button on the 440C-CR30 safety relay. Press the external Start button. The hazardous motion must resume. 7 While the machine continues to run, short the A1 terminal of the K1 coil to DC COM. The 440C- CR30 safety relay must trip. The red Fault status indicator LED on the 440C-CR30 safety relay is ON. 133 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery 8 Disconnect the A1 terminal of the K1 coil from DC COM. Press and release the Reset button on the 440C-CR30 safety relay. The 440C-CR30 safety relay must not respond. 9 Cycle power to the 440C-CR30 safety relay. The 440C-CR30 safety relay responds. The Fault status indicator LED on the 440C-CR30 safety relay is OFF. 10 Press and release the Reset button on the 440C-CR30 safety relay. Press the external Start button. The hazardous motion resumes. 11 to 21 Repeat steps 1 to 10 using is a requirement that machinery must be properly maintained. This will normally mean that there must be a routine and planned preventive maintenance schedule. It is recommended that a log is compiled and kept up to date. This is especially important in cases where the maintenance and inspection of equipment contributes to the continuing safety integrity of a protective device or system. The Annex of the U.W.E. Directive gives general minimum requirements applicable to work equipment. If the equipment conforms to relevant product directives, e.g., The Machinery Directive, they will automatically comply with the corresponding machine design requirements given in the minimum requirements of the Annex. Member states are allowed to issue legislation regarding the use of work equipment that goes beyond the minimum requirements of the U.W.E. Directive. 12 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Regulations Detailed information on the Use of Work Equipment Directive can be found at the offi cial EU website: https://osha.europa.eu/en/legislation/directives/3 U.S. Regulations This section introduces some of the industrial machine guarding safety regulations in the U.S. This is only a starting point; readers must further investigate the requirements for their specifi c applications and take measures to ensure that their designs, uses and maintenance procedures and practices meet their own needs as well as national and local codes and regulations. There are many organizations that promote industrial safety in the United States. These include: 1. Corporations, which use established requirements as well as establish their own internal requirements; 2. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA); 3. Industrial organizations like the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), the Robotics Industries Association (RIA), and the Association of Manufacturing Technology (AMT), ANSI which publishes a list of recognized consensus standards; and the suppliers of safety products and solutions such as Rockwell Automation. Occupational Safety and Health Administration In the United EO_19 in place of EO_18, and K2 in place of K1. 22 Connect the A1 terminal of K1 to the A1 terminal of K2.
