ENVIRONMENT, SAFETY & HEALTH DIVISION Chapter 25: Machine and Portable Tools Machine Safeguarding Guideline Product ID: 271 | Revision ID: 2351 | Date published: 19 July 2021 | Date effective: 19 July 2021 URL: https://www-group.slac.stanford.edu/esh/eshmanual/references/toolsGuideMachineGuardOptions.pdf 1 Purpose The purpose of these guidelines is to provide effective safeguards. They cover the selection of safeguarding methods. They apply to machine and shop custodians. 2 Guidelines If a machine-specific evaluation or other inspection reveals areas of the machine whose moving parts pose a potential hazard to operators or others nearby, guarding can be accomplished by one or a combination of the methods below.1 Whichever safeguard or combination of safeguards is chosen, it must 1. Prevent the worker’s body or clothing from contacting hazardous moving parts 2. Be firmly secured to machine and not easily removed 3. Not allow falling objects to enter moving parts 4. Create no new hazards (must not have shear points, jagged edges or unfinished surfaces) 5. Create no interference (must not prevent worker from performing the job quickly and comfortably) 6. Allow safe lubrication (the person should be able to lubricate the machine without removing the safeguard) 1 Content based on Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Concepts and Techniques of Machine Safeguarding (OSHA Publication 3067) and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Health and Safety Manual, Chapter 25, “Machine Guarding - Shop and Lab Machine Safety” 19 July 2021 SLAC-I-730-0A21T-016-R003 1 of 12 SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory Environment, Safety & Health Division Machine and Portable Tools | Machine Safeguarding Guideline 2.1 Guards 2.1.1 Fixed A fixed guard provides a barrier, a permanent part of the machine, preferable to all other types of guards. 2.1.2 Interlocked When an interlocked guard is opened or removed, the tripping mechanism or power automatically shuts off or disengages, and the machine cannot cycle or be started until the guard is back in place. 19 July 2021 SLAC-I-730-0A21T-016-R003 2 of 12 SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory Environment, Safety & Health Division Machine and Portable Tools | Machine Safeguarding Guideline 2.1.3 Adjustable An adjustable guard provides a barrier that may be adjusted to facilitate a variety of production operations. Adjustable guards are useful because they allow flexibility in accommodating various sizes of stock, but, because they require adjusting, they are subject to human error. 2.1.4 Self-adjusting A self-adjusting guard provides a barrier that moves according to the size of the stock entering the danger area. Self-adjusting guards avoid the potential for human error associated with adjustable guards. 19 July 2021 SLAC-I-730-0A21T-016-R003 3 of 12 SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory Environment, Safety & Health Division Machine and Portable Tools | Machine Safeguarding Guideline 2.2 Safety Devices A safety device may perform one of several functions:  It may stop the machine if a hand or any part of the body is inadvertently placed in the danger area.  It may restrain or withdraw the operator's hands from the danger area during operation.  It may require the operator to use both hands on machine controls, thus keeping both hands and body out of danger.  It may provide a barrier that is synchronized with the operating cycle of the machine in order to prevent entry to the danger area during the hazardous part of the cycle. 2.2.1 Presence Sensing Presence-sensing devices: radio frequency (capacitance) (left); photoelectrical (optical) (right) A presence-sensing device uses a system of light or radio beam (capacitance) sources and controls that can interrupt the machine's operating cycle. If the sensing field is broken, the machine stops and will not cycle. This device must be used only on machines that can be stopped before the worker can reach the danger area. The design and placement of the guard depends upon the time it takes to stop the mechanism and the speed at which the person’s hand can reach across the distance from the guard to the danger zone. 19 July 2021 SLAC-I-730-0A21T-016-R003 4 of 12 SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory Environment, Safety & Health Division Machine and Portable Tools | Machine Safeguarding Guideline 2.2.1.1 Electromechanical Sensing Device An electromechanical presence-sensing device has a probe or contact bar that descends to a predetermined distance when the operator initiates the machine cycle. If there is an obstruction preventing it from descending its full pre-determined distance, the control unit does not actuate the machine cycle. 2.2.2 Pullback A pullback utilizes a series of cables attached to the operator’s hands, wrists, or arms which withdraws hands when the slide/ram begins to descend. It is primarily used on machines with full-revolution stroking action and allows access to the point of operation when the slide/ram is up. 19 July 2021 SLAC-I-730-0A21T-016-R003 5 of 12 SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory Environment, Safety & Health Division Machine and Portable Tools | Machine Safeguarding Guideline 2.2.3 Restraint A restraint uses cables or straps attached to the operator’s hands and a fixed point. It must be adjusted to let the operator’s hands travel within a predetermined safe area. 2.3 Safety Controls 2.3.1 Pressure-sensitive Body Bar When depressed, a pressure-sensitive body bar will deactivate the machine. If the operator or anyone trips, loses balance, or is drawn into the machine, applying pressure to the bar will stop the operation. 19 July 2021 SLAC-I-730-0A21T-016-R003 6 of 12 SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory Environment, Safety & Health Division Machine and Portable Tools | Machine Safeguarding Guideline 2.3.2 Safety Triprod When pressed by the operator's hand, a safety tripod deactivates the machine. Because it has to be actuated by the operator during emergency situations, proper position is critical. 2.3.3 Safety Tripwire Cable A safety tripwire cable is a device located around the perimeter of or near the danger area. Operator must be able to reach the cable to stop the machine. Tripwire cables must be manually reset to restart the machine. 19 July 2021 SLAC-I-730-0A21T-016-R003 7 of 12 SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory Environment, Safety & Health Division Machine and Portable Tools | Machine Safeguarding Guideline 2.3.4 Two-hand Control A two-hand control requires constant, concurrent pressure to activate the machine. This kind of control requires a
