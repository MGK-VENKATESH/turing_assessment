The directional valves comply with the quiescent current principle and have sufficient positive overlap. The non- return valves must be engineered to assume an open state, even with failure, to safely exhaust the cylinder chambers. The switching valve function of 1V1 and 2V1 is periodically checked by querying the cylinder position switches 1S1 and 1S2 and the pressure switch 2S1.

For the complete safety function, additional safety- related control components (e.g. as guards and electrical logic) must be added as subsystems. In the basic valve position, the pressure in the cylinder is chambered; the cylinder stops when forces are balanced. Stopping/holding the cylinder occurs redundantly via two paths: • If 2V1 is not actuated, the valves 2V2 and 2V3 will remain in the locked position. • If 1V1 is not 2006/42/EC (EU Machinery Regulation EU 2023/1230 starting from January 20th, 2027) on machine engineering aims to ensure a common safety level for new machines distributed and operated in the member states. It governs safety and occupational health requirements for design and engineering. The CE mark indicates that the manufacturer has achieved an adequate level of protection. Harmonized standards from the European standards organizations provide additional assistance to machine operators and manufacturers, since they enhance compliance with the Machinery Directive (EU Machinery Regulation EU 2023/1230 starting from January 20th, 2027) through what is called “presumption of conformity”. This principle, however, only applies to the legal requirements that the harmonized standards actually cover. Almost all laws worldwide mandate a risk assessment to analyze and assess risks and finally implement mitigating measures. Machine-specific standards • B1-type standards cover specific safety • A-type standards (basic safety standards) aspects(e.g. safety clearances, surface define basic concepts, terminology and temperature, noise) design principles that can be applied to • B2-type standards cover protective devices machines (e.g. two-hand circuits, guards) • B-type standards (generic safety standards) • C-type standards (machine safety standards) deal with a single safety aspect or protective contain detailed safety requirements for a device for a series of machines certain machine EN 693 EN 474 EN 1010 ISO 23125 IEC 61800-5-2 IEC 60204 Electrical equipment IEC 61508 Electronic controls ISO 4413 Legal basis Hydraulics Example: Machinery Directive IEC 62061 IEC 62061 ISO 4414 Electrical machine control Pneumatics Basic standards ISO 12100 A-type standards Risk evaluation ISO 13849 Machine control ISO 13850 Generic standards Emergency OFF device B-type standards Precedence and presumption of conformity ISO 13855 Positioning of safeguards C-type standards: product standards with respect to the approach speeds of parts of the human body 4 Machine safety | Basic conditions Hazards and risks: Estimate – actuated, the valve locks in the center position. Extending and retracting the cylinder is only possible with the combined actuation of 1V and 2V1, and thus 2V2 and 2V3. The safety-related switching position is achieved by removing the electrical control signal. Failure of one of the valves does not jeopardize the safety function. Further measures are required if captive compressed air presents an additional hazard. Design features 1S1 1S2 Basic and well-tried safety principles 1A1 are met for all relevant components.
