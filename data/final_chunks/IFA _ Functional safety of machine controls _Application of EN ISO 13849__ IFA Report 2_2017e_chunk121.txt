It is followed by measures necessary for Correspondence between the probability of failure and the the control of systematic failures (subclause 6.1.2) and Performance Level ergonomic design aspects (subclause 6.1.3). Subclause 6.2 describes the Categories and the simplified method Performance Average probability of a dangerous based upon them for evaluation of the quantifiable Level (PL) failure per hour (PFH ) in h-1 D aspects. Subclause 6.3 then presents requirements a ≥ 10-5 to < 10-4 upon the software. Finally, subclause 6.4 shows which b ≥ 3 ⋅ 10-6 to < 10-5 quantifiable aspects must be considered when SRP/CSs c ≥ 10-6 to < 3 ⋅ 10-6 are used in combination. Figure 6.2 explains the need for this additional subclause. The machine control sys- d ≥ 10-7 to < 10-6 tem (CS) as a whole is divided into safety-related parts e ≥ 10-8 to < 10-7 (SRP/CS) and the non-safety-related parts; the latter are generally substantially more comprehensive and serve only to perform normal operating functions. The combi- In principle, any method (e.g. Markov calculations, Petri nation of safety-related parts of a control system begins nets) may be used to prove the probability of failure. The at the point at which safety-related signals are generated following criteria must however always be observed: (these include, for example, the actuating cam and rol- ler of a position switch), and ends at the outputs of the • Quantifiable aspects (structure, component reliability, power control elements (for example including the main diagnostics in the form of tests, common cause failure) contacts of a contactor).
