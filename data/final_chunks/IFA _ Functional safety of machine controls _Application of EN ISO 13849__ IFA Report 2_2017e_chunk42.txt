the process in the event of failure of actuation of the deceleration ramp leads to a DC of 60% for K5. For T1, the DC is 60%, likewise as a result of fault detection by the process. K1 and K2 exhibit a DC of 99% owing to the integral fault detection in K4. For K3, the DC is 99% owing to fault detection by K5. For C1, the DC is 60% owing to testing in the PLC of the timing element with the FI shut-off by way of the drop-out time of the contactor relay K3. For Q1, the DC is then 99% owing to direct monitoring in K5. The averaging formula for the DC yields a result of avg 64% (“low”). • Adequate measures against common cause failure (75 points): separation (15), diversity (20), FMEA (5) and envi- ronmental conditions (25 + 10) • The two-channel combination of the control elements satisfies Category 3. This yields an average probability of dangerous failure PFH of 3.9 · 10-7 per hour. This satisfies PL d. Addition of the probability of dangerous failure of D K4 and S3 yields an overall probability of failure of 7.4 · 10-7 per hour. This also then satisfies PL d. • The wearing contactor Q1 should be replaced after approximately 7.8 years (T ). 10D More detailed references • Werner, C.; Zilligen, H.; Köhler, B.; Apfeld, R.: Safe drive controls with frequency inverters.

The failure is dependent upon the reliability of the directional control valve. • Testing of the safety function is forced via the PLC K1 by means of a displacement measurement system 1S1. Testing takes place at suitable intervals and in response to a demand of the safety function. Detection of failure of 1V1 leads to the exhaust valve 0V1 being switched off. • Interruption of the hazardous movement by means of the exhaust valve 0V1 generally results in a longer overrun. The distance from the hazard zone must be selected in consideration of the longer overrun. • The test function must not be impaired by failure of the directional control valve. Failure of the test function must not lead to failure of the directional control valve. • Should trapped compressed air pose a further hazard, additional measures are required. Design features • Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. • 1V1 is a directional control valve with closed centre position, sufficient overlap and spring-centred central position. • The safety-oriented switching position is attained by cancellation of the control signal. • Testing may for example take the form of checking of the time/distance characteristic (displacement measurement system 1S1) of the hazardous movements in conjunction with the switching position of the directional control valve, with evaluation in a PLC (K1). • K1 must not be used for the electrical drive of 1V1. • In order to prevent a systematic failure, the higher-level de-energization function (acting upon exhaust valve 0V1 in this example) is checked at suitable intervals, e.g. daily. • For use in applications with infrequent operator intervention in the hazard zone. This enables the requirement of the designated architecture for Category 2 to be satisfied. The requirement is for testing to be performed immedia- tely when a demand is made upon the safety function, and for the total time for detection of the failure and placing of the machine in a non-hazardous state, for example in consideration of the overrun, which depends upon factors including the depressurization and switching times of the valves (depressurization in this case is at a higher level via the valve 0V1), to be shorter than the time to attainment of the hazard (see also EN ISO 13855 and cf. sub- clause 6.2.14). • The standard component K1 is employed in accordance with the information in subclause 6.3.10. • The software (SRASW) is programmed in accordance with the requirements for PL b (downgraded owing to diver- sity) and the information in subclause 6.3. 133 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS Calculation of the probability of failure • MTTF of the functional channel: a B value of 20,000,000 switching cycles [S] is assumed for the directional con- D 10D trol valve 1V1. At 240 working days, 16 working hours per day and a cycle time of 5 seconds, n is 2,764,800 swit- op ching cycles per year and the MTTF is 72.3 years.
