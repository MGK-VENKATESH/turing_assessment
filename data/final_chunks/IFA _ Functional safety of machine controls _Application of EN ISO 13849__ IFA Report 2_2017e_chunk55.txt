description • This example shows implementation of the SLS safety function with a frequency inverter without integrated safety function. The SLS safety function is used for example for inching mode during servicing tasks. • A hazardous movement is safely prevented or interrupted when the safety guard is open. Opening of the safety guard is detected by two position switches B1 and B2 employing a break-contact/make-contact element combi- nation. When the pushbutton S1 is actuated, a movement at a safely limited speed (inching mode) is initiated by means of the safety PLC K1. The two processing channels within the PLC each process a set limit value. The actual value of the limited speed on the inputs I3.0 and I3.1 of K1 is monitored by two separate rotary encoders G1 and G2. Each channel of the PLC performs the desired/actual speed comparison independently. Should the speed not be reduced successfully to the limited value by means of T1, K1 can initiate a halt by blocking the start/stop signal and servo enable on the frequency inverter. The power supply to T1 is also interrupted by the mains contactor relay Q1 after a programmed timeout. • The two-channel safety PLC K1 performs internal fault detection. Should one processing channel fail, the remaining (i.e. functioning) processing channel reduces the speed of the frequency inverter T1 and de-energizes the mains contactor relay Q1. A failure of the frequency inverter that could for example lead to unexpected start-up, continued running or an increase in the speed is detected by separate monitoring of the speed by the rotary encoders G1 and G2 in the two processing channels. Failure of the mains contactor relay Q1 to drop out is detected by the break- contact element connected to both processing channels (inputs I2.0 and I2.1 of K1), and leads both to blocking of the start/stop signal and of servo enable on the inverter by both processing channels. 172 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS B1 G1 T1 K1 B2 G2 Q1 Design features • Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. Protective circuits (such as contact protection) as described in the initial paragraphs of Chapter 8 are implemented. • A stable arrangement of the safeguard is assured for actuation of the position switch. • The position switch B1 features direct opening action in accordance with IEC 60947-5-1, Annex K. The position switch B2 also complies with IEC 60947-5-1. • The contactor Q1 possesses a mirror contact in accordance with IEC 60947-4-1, Annex F. • The supply conductors to the position switches are laid either separately or with protection against mechanical damage. • For the “safely limited speed” safety function, a fault exclusion is assumed for the fault condition of encoder shaft breakage (G1/G2). Details of the possibility of a fault exclusion can be found for example in IEC 61800-5-2, Table D.8, and GS-IFA-M21. • The standard components G1 and G2 (where relevant for the rotary encoders) and T1 are employed in accordance with the information in subclause 6.3.10. • The safety component K1 satisfies all requirements for Category 3 and PL d. The software (SRASW) is programmed in accordance with the requirements for PL d and the information in subclause 6.3.10. • It is assumed that each output of the safety PLC is actuated by both processing channels of the PLC and that the analog output 03 is monitored by two channels. Calculation of the probability of failure • The SRP/CS is divided into the two subsystems sensor/actuator and PLC. For the PLC subsystem, a tested safety PLC suitable for PL d is employed. This PLC‘s probability of failure of 1.5 · 10-7 per hour [E] is added at the end of the calculation for the sensor/actuator subsystem. For the composition of the block diagram, refer also to Figure 6.14 and the relevant information in the associated text. The probability of failure for the sensor/actuator subsystem is calculated below. • MTTF : at 240 working days, 8 working hours and a cycle time of one hour, n is 1,920 cycles per year. A B value D op 10D of 20,000,000 cycles [S] is assumed for the position switch B1 owing to its direct opening action; the associated MTTF value is 104,166.7 years. Owing to the defined control current (low load; the mechanical durability of the con- D tacts is the determining factor), a B value of 100,000 cycles [E] is assumed for the make-contact element, which 10D is opened by spring force (see also Table D.2), and therefore an MTTF of 520 years. The contactor Q1, with a B D 10D value of 400,000 cycles, switches operationally only once daily, equating to an n of 240 cycles per year and an op MTTF of 16,667 years. The following manufacturer‘s values are available: an MTTF of 100 years for T1 and an MTTF D D D of 190 years for G1/G2 [M]. These values yield a symmetrized MTTF of each channel of 84 years (“high”). D • DC : a DC of 99% is assumed for each of the components used. For the position switches and the rotary encoders, avg this value is based upon cross monitoring of input signals in K1. For the frequency inverter T1, the speed is moni- tored in the safety PLC via the two rotary encoders, and fault detection is provided by the process; the main contac- tor relay Q1 is monitored directly by the PLC. These values yield a DC of 99% (“high”). avg 173 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS • Adequate measures against common cause failure (70 points): separation (15), FMEA (5), overvoltage protection etc. (15) and environmental conditions (25 + 10) • The sensor/actuator subsystem satisfies Category 3 with a high MTTF of each channel (84 years) and high DC D avg (99%). This results in an average probability of dangerous failure PFH of 3.0 · 10-8 per hour. This satisfies PL e. D A PL of d is thus surpassed, which with the required two-channel
