These operating instructions supplied with the machine must either be the ‚Äúoriginal operating instructions‚Äù or a ‚Äútranslation of the original operating instructions‚Äù. In the latter case, the original operating instructions must also be supplied (all operating instructions for which the manufacturer assumes responsibility are deemed to be ‚Äúoriginal operating instructions‚Äù).

CEN prepares the European Standards (EN) in non-electrical areas. To prevent these standards representing barri‚Äê ers to trade, CEN collaborates with ISO. Using a voting procedure, CEN determines whether ISO standards are adopted and publishes them as European standards. CENELEC (Comit√© Europ√©en de Normalisation Electrotechnique/European Commit‚Äê tee for Electrotechnical Standardization) CENELEC is the comparable institution to CEN in the area of electrical technology, and prepares and publishes European standards (EN) in this area. CENELEC is increas‚Äê ingly adopting IEC standards and their numbering system. 18 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice ¬ß ‚Äì LAWS, DIRECTIVES, STANDARDS National standardization organizations and structures As a rule each EU member state has its own standardization organization, e.g., DIN, ON, BSI, AFNOR. These prepare and publish national standards in accordance with the of safety requirements is something that ought to be taken into account as early as when purchasing a machine. How should machinery be purchased? The procurement process is crucial to the success of a project to build or modernize a production facility. The following points, for example, should be considered: ‚Ä¢ For complex assemblies of machines, designate a ‚Äúsite manager‚Äù in accordance with the Machinery Directive. ‚Ä¢ Clarify the procedure for the machinery or machine components provided in advance. ‚Ä¢ Draw up a contract specifying how additional documentation is to be provided (e.g., risk assessment, etc.) so that it will be easier to make changes downstream. ‚Ä¢ Define, as far as possible, the usage of important standards (harmonized standards in the EU) as the basis. ‚Ä¢ Agree on a procedure in the event of deviations from harmonized standards. Safety inspections Experience shows that in practice, machine safety is not perfect. Protective devices are often manipulated by the machine operator in order to work without hindrance. Other problems are the incorrect positioning of protective devices and improper integration into control systems. The safety state of work equipment and systems in operation is regulated by EU Directive 2009/104 / EC (‚ÄúWork Equipment Directive‚Äù); it shall be inspected to ensure conformance with applicable national legislation. In particular, Article 4a of the Directive defines the inspection of work equipment. Technical rules, standards or certain regulations can serve as a guide as to how the inspection should be carried out. The user of the respective equipment must perform a risk assessment and is responsible for ensuring that the inspection is carried out and that occupational safety is ensured. In so doing, the user shall ensure that work equipment is inspected in accordance with the national transposition of the Work Equipment Directive to the country of
