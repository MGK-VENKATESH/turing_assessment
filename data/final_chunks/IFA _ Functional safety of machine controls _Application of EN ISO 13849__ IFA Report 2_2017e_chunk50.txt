is a position switch with make contact. The B is 1 · 105 switching cycles [M]. D 10D For the position switch B2 with direct opening action and roller actuation, the B is 20 · 106 switching cycles [M]. 10D At 220 working days, 16 working hours per day and a cycle time of 10 minutes, n is 21,120 cycles per year for op these components, and the MTTF is 47.3 years for B1 and 9,469 years for B2. D For the contactor Q1, the B value corresponds under inductive load (AC 3) to an electrical durability of 1,000,000 10 switching cycles [M]. If 50% of failures are assumed to be dangerous, the B value is produced by doubling of the 10D B value. Since Q1 is involved in both safety-related stop functions, double the value assumed above for n yields 10 op an MTTF of 473 years. The MTTF for the frequency inverter T1 is 20 years [M]. Altogether, the symmetrized MTTF D D D value per channel in the subsystem Q1/T1 is 68.9 years (“high”). The position switch B1 exhibits a limited opera- tion time of 4.7 years. Its replacement in good time is recommended. • MTTF (guard 2, unloading): for the position switch B3 with separate actuator and the direct opening contacts B3.1 D and B3.2, a B value of 4,000,000 cycles [M] is stated for each contact. At 220 working days, 16 working hours per 10D day and a cycle time of 10 minutes, n for these components is 21,120 cycles per year, and the MTTF 1,893 years. op D For the contactor Q1, the B value corresponds under inductive load (AC 3) to the electrical durability of 1,000,000 10 switching cycles [M]. Since 50% of failures are assumed to be dangerous, the B value is produced by doubling of 10D the B value.

D • DC : the DC of 99% for B1 and B2/B3 is based upon plausibility monitoring in K2/K3. This corresponds to the DC avg avg for the subsystem. The DC of 99% for the contactor Q1 is derived from readback of the contact position in the safety modules. Fault detection by the process yields a DC of 60% for the frequency inverter T1. Averaging thus results in a DC of 62% (“low”) for the subsystem Q1/T1. An adequate test rate of the emergency-stop device is assured (refer avg to the information in subclauses 6.2.14 and D.2.5.1). • Adequate measures against common cause failure in the subsystems S1.1/S1.2, B2/B1, B3.1/B3.2 and Q1/T2 (65, 70 or 85 points): separation (15), protection against overvoltage etc. (15) and environmental conditions (25 + 10), well-tried components in B2/B1 (5), diversity in Q1/T1 (20) • The subsystems B1/B2 and B3.1/B3.2 correspond to Category 4 with a high MTTF and high DC (99%). This results D avg in an average probability of dangerous failure of 3.3 · 10-8 per hour and 2.5 · 10-8 per hour. The subsystem Q1/ T1 satisfies Category 3 with a high MTTF (68.9 years) and low DC (62%). This results in an average probability D avg of dangerous failure of 1.8 · 10-7 per hour for the safety function of “position monitoring of interlocking devices (guard 1, loading)”. 158 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS • For the safety function of “position monitoring of interlocking devices (guard 2, unloading)”, the average probabi- lity of dangerous failure is 2.1 · 10-7 per hour. This corresponds in both cases to PL d. • The average probability of dangerous failure for the emergency stop function is 2.0 · 10-7 per hour. This satisfies PL d.

Functional description • Opening of the movable guard (e.g. safety guard) is detected by two position switches B1 and B2 employing a break contact/make contact combination. The position switch B1 with direct opening contact actuates a contactor Q2, which interrupts/prevents hazardous movements or states when it drops out. The position switch B2 with make contact is read in by a standard PLC K1, which can bring about the same de-energization response by actua- tion of a second contactor Q1. • The safety function is retained in the event of a component failure. • The switching position of B1 is also read into the PLC K1 by means of a make contact, and is compared for plausibi- lity with the switching position of B2. The switching position of the contactors Q1 and Q2 is likewise monitored in K1 by mirror contacts. Component failures in B1, B2, Q1 and Q2 are detected by K1 and lead to operating inhibition owing to the dropping-out of Q1 and Q2. Faults in the PLC K1 are detected only by the function (fault detection by the process). 160 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS B1 Q2 B2 K1 Q1 Design features • Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met.
