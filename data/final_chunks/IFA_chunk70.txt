unit K1 monitors operation of the actuators (pushbuttons) S1 and S2. Only when both pushbuttons are operated synchronously (i.e. within a maximum time of 500 ms as specified in EN 574) from within the released state do the contactor relays K2 and K3 pick up, resulting in enabling. When at least one of the pushbuttons S1/S2 is released, K2/K3 cancel enabling. • K2 and K3 have the function of contactmultiplication/load adaptation. The actual prevention of the hazardous movement, for example by separation of the electrical or hydraulic energy, is dependent upon the application and is not shown here. • Faults in the actuating mechanism are detected in S1/S2 to the greatest extent possible by the use of two con- tacts employing different principles (break and make contact combination). In accordance with Recommendation for Use (RfU) CNB/M/11.033/R/E Rev 06, mechanical faults on the actuators can be excluded when they satisfy IEC 60947-5-1. 230 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS S1/13-14 S2/21-22 K2 K1 S2/13-14 S1/21-22 K3 • Faults in S1/S2 and in K2/K3 (with break contacts in the feedback circuit) are detected in K1 and lead to sustained de-energization via K2 and K3. All individual faults are detected at or prior to the next demand of the safety func- tion. • Frequent actuation of the electromechanical elements results in a sufficiently high test rate (forced dynamics). Design features • Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. Protective circuits (such as contact protection), as described in subclause 8.1, are implemented. • The actuators S1 and S2 of the two-hand control satisfy IEC 60947-5-1. In accordance with RfU CNB/M/11.033/R/E Rev 06, mechanical faults can therefore be excluded. • Faults in the conductors to S1 and S2 are detected in the logic device. If this were not possible, the conditions to EN ISO 13849-2, Table D.4 for a fault exclusion for conductor short circuits would have to be observed. Owing to the low currents, pushbuttons with gold-plated contacts are recommended. • Refer to EN 574, subclauses 8 and 9 with regard to fitting of the pushbuttons and measures for the avoidance of accidental actuation and defeating. The safety distance from the hazard zone must be sufficientlygreat. • The logic unit K1 satisfies Type III C to EN 574, with self-monitoring and detection of internal faults. K1 is a tested safety component for use in Category 4 and PL e. • The contactor relays K2 and K3 possess mechanically linked break contacts in accordance with IEC 60947-5-1, Annex L for feedback. Remarks • The example shown is suitable for application for example on mechanical presses (EN 692). Calculation of the probability of failure • K1 is considered as a subsystem with a probability of failure of 3.0 · 10-9 per hour [M]. The remaining part of the control system is grouped to form a Category 4 subsystem the probability of failure of which is calculated below. • Since S1 and S2 must initiate de-energization independently of each other when released, they are connected logically in series. For this purpose, one make contact 13-14 and one break contact 21-22 were each assigned to a control channel. The safety-related block diagram differs substantially in this respect from the functional circuit diagram. If the reliability data are available only for the pushbuttons as a whole (actuation mechanism and break and make contacts), the failure values for the pushbuttons may be employed as an estimation erring on the safe side for the failure values for the contacts (plus operating mechanism). • MTTF : owing to the defined control current generated by K1 (low electrical load; the mechanical durability of the D contacts is the determining factor), B values of 2,000,000 switching cycles [M] are assumed in each case for 10D S1 and S2. At 240 working days, 8 working hours and a cycle time of 30 seconds, n is 230,400 cycles per year op for these components, and the MTTF is 86.8 years per contact. Since K2 and K3 alsoswitch control currents, D B values of 20,000,000 cycles [S] and resulting MTTF values of 868 years apply to each of them. Should the 10D D re quirements be higher (longer working hours or a shorter cycle time), higher B values validated by the manu- 10D facturer may be required for K2/K3. Overall, the resulting MTTF value per channel is 41 years (“high”). D 231 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS • DC : a DC of 99% for S1 and S2 is achieved by virtue of direct monitoring with the aid of the break/make contact avg combinations in K1. The DC of 99% for K2 and K3 is based upon readback of the mechanically linked break contacts in the feedback circuit of K1. The high frequency of actuation in the application results in frequent testing (see sub- clause 6.2.14). Averaging results in a DC of 99% (“high”). avg • Adequate measures against common cause failure (70 points): separation (15), FMEA (5), overvoltage protection etc. (15) and environmental conditions (25 + 10) • The combination of the control elements satisfies Category 4 with a high MTTF per channel (41 years) and high D DC (99%). For the combination of S1, S2, K2 and K3, the average probability of dangerous failure is calculated at avg 6.7 · 10-8 per hour. If a value of 3.0 · 10-9 per hour [E] for K1 is added, the result is an average probability of dange- rous failure of 7.0 · 10-8 per hour. This satisfies PL e. The probability of failure of downstream power components may have to be added for completion of the safety function. • The wearing elements S1 and S2 should each be replaced at intervals of approximately eight years (T ). 10D More detailed references • EN 574: Safety of machinerysuitability for application in practice, and subclauses of the standard and of the present report. also consistent precision of when “SRP/CS” refers to the entire control system executing a safety function, and The example
