that the connection of another device – either locally or remotely – doesn’t lead to a hazardous situation. In addition, any hardware component that transmits signals or data and has access to software that is critical for the machinery’s compliance to relevant health and safety requirements, needs to be protected against both accidental or intentional corruption, and will collect evidence of both legitimate or illegitimate interventions. Finally, for protection against corruption, software and data that are critical for the compliance of the machinery or related products with the relevant health and safety requirements, shall be identified as such and shall be adequately protected against accidental or intentional corruption. The machinery or related product shall identify the software installed on it that is necessary for it to operate safely; and shall be able to provide that information at all times in an easily accessible form. The machinery or related product shall collect evidence of a legitimate or illegitimate intervention in the software or a modification of the software installed on the machinery or related product or its configuration.

Safety and reliability of control systems (Clause 1.2.1) Control systems shall be designed and constructed in such a way as to prevent hazardous situations from occuring. They also should withstand where appropriate to the circumstances and risks, the intended operating stresses and intended and unintended external influences, including reasonably foreseeable malicious attempts from third parties leading to a hazardous situation. It’s here that the link between safety and cybersecurity is evident. There is also the need for a tracing log containing the data generated in relation to an intervention, and of the versions of the safety software uploaded after the machinery or related product has been placed on the market or put into service. This needs to be enabled for five years after such an upload. The requirement here is exclusively to demonstrate the conformity of the machinery or the related product with this EHSRs should a reasonable request from a competent national authority be made. For OEMs developing control systems or logic with fully or partially self-evolving behavior, that are designed to operate with varying levels of autonomy, additional requirements have been added into the EHSRs in Annex III. They shall not cause the machinery or related product to perform actions beyond their defined task and movement space. Recording of data on the safety related decision-making process for software-based safety systems ensuring safety functions must be enabled and retained for one year after the machinery or related product is place on to the market or put into service. At all times it must be possible to correct the machinery or related product in order to maintain its inherent safety.

The person that carries out the substantial modification should be required to perform a new conformity assessment before placing the modified product on the market or putting it into service. This conformity assessment can be restricted to the part of the production line that has been modified, and so does not have to be completed for the whole assembly.

However, self- certification is still possible as long as the COMPLIANCE ROUTE machinery is in Annex I Part B and is built preferably using harmonized standards or a common specification.
