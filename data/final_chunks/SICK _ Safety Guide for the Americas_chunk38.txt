A list of relevant standards is provided in the § annex. Relevant international and local standards are listed in Annex i starting g i­6. Different types of standards There are three different types of standards: C-type standards A-type standards C-type standards contain all safety requirements for a specific (Basic safety standards) contain basic terminology, principles machine or a type of machine. If this standard exists, it has pri­ of design and general aspects that can be applied to all ma­ ority over the A­type or B­type standard. Nevertheless, a C­type chinery. standard can refer to a B­type standard or an A­type standard. In all circumstances the legal requirements of the region shall B-type standards be met. (Group safety standards) address a safety aspect or protective device that can be used for a wide range of machinery. B­type standards are in turn divided into: • B1-type standards on special safety aspects, e.g., the elec­ trical safety of machinery, the calculation of safety distanc­ es, requirements for control systems • B2-type standards on protective devices, e.g., two­hand controls, physical guards and electro­sensitive protective equipment - You will find a list of important standards in the “Overview of the relevant standards” section of the Annex g i­6. 7028282/2014-09-08 GUIDE FOR SAFE MACHINERY | SICK §§--1111 Subject to change without notice International/European Standards Laws, regulations, directives, standards Overview of protective devices and related standards § Non-Technical Safeguarding & Risk Assessment Inherent Safety measures ISO 12100 Complementary measures [EN 292 & EN 1050] Machine Equipment Electrical Components IEC 60204-1 Hydraulic Components ISO 4413 Pneumatic Components ISO 4414 Minimum Gaps to Avoid Crushing ISO 13854 [EN 349] Protective Devices (SRP/CS) Physical Guards Safety Distances ISO 13857 [EN 294 & EN 811] Safety-Related Parts of Control Systems ISO 14120 Position of Protective Equipment ISO 13855 [EN 999] ISO 13849-1 ISO 13849-2 [EN953] Prevent Unexpected Start-Up ISO 14118 [EN 1037] [EN 954] A-Type Standards B-Type Standards C-Type Standards Fixed Movable With Approach Function Fixed Position Non-Fixed Motion Control Position Design Standard Fences & Doors, gates, Sensitive Protective Equipment (SPE) barriers traps & IEC TS 62046 removable by barriers using tools operated cyclic or non-cyclic Pressure Electro-Sensitive Sensitive Protective Two-Hand Enabling Device Protective Equipment Controls (may have Interlocking Equipment Emergency Stop) (ESPE) Devices (PSPE) I [ S E O N 1 1 4 0 1 8 1 8 9 ] ISO 13856-x IEC 61496-1 ISO 13851 IEC 60204-1 [EN 1760-x] [EN 574] Mats AOPD1) Emergency Stop Limiting Means ISO 13856-1 IEC 61496-2 ISO 13850 • Speed [EN 418] • Travel Edges AOPDDR2) • Force ISO 13856-2 IEC 61496-3 EMERGENCY STOP • Pressure IS A SAFETY Bumpers VBPD3) FUNCTION BUT ISO/PDTS 15066 NOT A PROTECTIVE ISO 13856-3 IEC/TR 61496-4 DEVICE!
