Besides the function; it does not contain control or display devices safety function, the microcontroller and the downstream for other machine functions. In the event of a fault, some drive control perform a number of other machine func- components in these circuit parts may have negative tions which, since they are not safety functions, will not repercussions for the safety function. Only then should be considered here. Although in this example, the safety these components be included in the function blocks that function is implemented entirely electrically, the princip- they could cause to fail. les described for the safety-related block diagram and the FMEA apply to all technologies. The safety-related block diagram will often take the form of one of the “designated architectures” in accordance with EN ISO 13849-1, subclause 6.2.2 (subclauses 6.2.1 to Annex B 6.2.7 of this report), as in the example presented here. In In both cases, the dangerous (i.e. unfavourable from a such cases, the method described in subclause 4.5.4 of safety perspective) failure rate, specifically its reciprocal, the standard (supplemented by Annexes B, C, D, E, I and the MTTF (mean time to dangerous failure), and the DC D K of the standard) may be applied for quantitative calcula- (diagnostic coverage) of the function
