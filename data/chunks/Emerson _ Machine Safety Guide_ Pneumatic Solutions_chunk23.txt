traversing speed. Optionally, a cover plate is The 3/2 directional valve with negative overlap: for the “safe available to safeguard against manipulation. exhaust” safety function, the valve design principle has to be taken into consideration. The 2x 3/2 NCNC directional valve 7 Pressure regulator: Reduced working pressure in the with non-detenting manual override presents an alternative to operating lines for force limitation in cylinders. the poppet valve. This valve does not have zero overlap in the switching transition, also referred to as negative overlap. Due to 8 Exhaust module: in case of emergency stop, cylinder its design, it cannot get caught in a position where all channels chambers may remain under pressure. To perform are closed. maintenance, release trapped personnel, or achieve correct workpiece positioning, the cylinder chambers Your advantages: • Optimized compressed air balance thanks to a small, • Long service life of over 150 million cycles. lightweight construction • Long valve system service life without requiring • Universal system for a variety of applications in safety- maintenance related controls • High flexibility thanks to easy application retrofitting The result: one solution for all your requirements. • Simplified design process with Engineering Tools 32 Machine safety | Emerson expertise – AV/AES 503 Zone Safety Valve system The 503 Zone Safety valve system enables functional safety with up to three independent safety zones on one valve system.
