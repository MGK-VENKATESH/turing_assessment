for the dual channel arrangement. Some Non-Contacts Interlocks and Emergency Stops: Mechanical contacts, dual channel, one normally open and one normally closed contact. The MSR must be able to process diverse inputs. Devices with solid state outputs: Light curtains, laser scanners and some non- contact guard interlocks have two sourcing outputs and perform their own cross- fault detection. The MSR must be able to ignore the devices cross-fault detection method. Pressure Sensitive Mats: Mats create a short circuit between two channels. The MSR must be specifi cally designed or confi gurable for this application. Pressure Sensitive Edges: Some edges are designed like 4-wire mats. Some are two wire devices that create a change in resistance. The MSR must be able to detect a short circuit or the change resistance. 43 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery Motor motion sensing: Measures the back EMF of a motor during rundown. The MSR must be able to tolerate high voltages as well as detect low voltages as the motor spins down. Stopped Motion: The MSR must detect pulse streams from diverse, redundant sensors. Two-hand Control: The MSR must detect normally open and normally closed diverse inputs as well as provide 0.5s timing and sequencing logic. Monitoring safety relays must be specifi cally designed or confi gurable to interface with each of these types of devices, as they have different electrical characteristics. Some MSRs are completely confi gurable into different types. Some MSRs can connect to a few different types of inputs, but once the device is chosen, the MSR can only interface with that device. The designer must select or confi gure an MSR that is compatible with the input device. Input Impedance The input impedance of the monitoring safety relays determines how many input devices can be connected to
