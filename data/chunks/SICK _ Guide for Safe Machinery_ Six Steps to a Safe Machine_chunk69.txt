Since the evaluation unit only evaluates the signals of the complete series, fault detection can be prevented. The fault, e.g. a short-circuit or cross-circuit, is either not detected at all or reset (masked) after detection as a result of the actuation of another 68 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION protective device with a fault-free switch. This means that operation of dangerous machine functions is possible despite the presence of an isolated fault. The accumulation of masked faults may then lead to the loss of the safety function. Example for the development of fault masking If it is assumed that, during foreseeable troubleshooting, one of the movable physical guards (e.g. protective door, maintenance flap) is operated by the machine operator and the fault is masked thereby, the corresponding reduction in the diagnostic coverage DC (fault recognition rate) has to be taken into account. This may lead to the performance level being reduced to PL d or PL c. NOTE For more information, see the special information “Safe series connection” from SICK. Electro-sensitive protective equipment (ESPE) With electro-sensitive protective equipment (ESPE), in contrast to “guards”, protection is not based on the physical separation of persons at risk from the hazard itself. Protection is achieved through temporal separation. As long as there is somebody in a defined area, no dangerous machine functions are initiated, and such functions are stopped if already underway. A certain amount of time, referred to as the “stopping/run-down time”, is required to stop these functions. The ESPE must detect the approach of a person to the hazardous area in a timely manner and depending on the application, the presence of the person in the hazardous area. The international standard IEC 61496-1 defines safety-related
