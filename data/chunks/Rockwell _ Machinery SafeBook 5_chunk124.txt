switch. This signals the programmable system to carry out a correctly sequenced stop. After a sufficient time has elapsed to allow this process, 108 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety-Related Control Systems, Additional Considerations the delayed output on the safety relay switches and isolates the main contactor. Note: Any calculations to determine the overall stopping time must take the safety relay output delay period into account. This is particularly important when using this factor to determine the positioning of devices in accordance with the safety distance calculation 2. Safety PLCs The logic and timing functions required can be conveniently implemented by using a Safety PLC such as GuardLogix. U.S. Safety Control System Requirements Control Reliable The highest level of risk reduction in the U.S. and Canadian robot standards is achieved by safety related control systems meeting the requirements of Control Reliable. Control reliable safety related control systems are dual channel architectures with monitoring. The stopping function of the robot must not be prevented by any single component failure, including the monitoring function. The monitoring shall generate a stop command upon detection of a fault. If a hazard remains after motion stops, a warning signal must be provided. The safety system must remain in a safe state until the fault is corrected. Preferably, the fault is detected at the time of the failure. If this cannot be achieved, then the failure must be detected at the next demand on the safety system. Common mode failures must be taken into consideration if a signifi cant probability of such a failure can occur. The Canadian requirements differ from the U.S. requirement by adding two additional requirements. First, the safety related control systems shall be independent of the normal program control systems. Second, the safety system must not be easily defeated or bypassed without detection. Comments
