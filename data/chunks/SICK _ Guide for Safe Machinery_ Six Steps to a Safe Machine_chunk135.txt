differential. Safety-related design principles For the safety-related use of valves, feedback of the valve position may be necessary. Here various techniques are used: • Reed switches that are actuated by a magnet fixed into the moving valve body • Inductive proximity switches that are actuated directly by the moving switching element of the valve • Analog position detection of the moving switching element of the valve • Pressure measurement downstream of the valve In the case of electromagnetically actuated valves, like a contactor, the solenoid requires a suppressor. In terms of safety as defined in ISO 13849, valves are defined as power control elements. The failure of drives/work elements must also be considered according to the possible repercussions. Figure 107: Valve with position monitoring Filter concept The vast majority of failures of fluid control systems are due to disturbances related to contamination of the related fluid. The two main causes are: 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 123 Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION • Contamination that occurs during assembly = assembly contamination (e.g., chips, mold sand, fibers from cloths, basic contamination) • Contamination that occurs during operation = operating contamination (e.g., ambient contamination, compo‐ nent abrasion) These contaminations must be reduced to an acceptable degree with the aid of filters. For this purpose, a filter concept must be developed that defines the filter principle and its installation location. The filter concept must be designed so that it is able to retain in the filter the contamination added to the entire system in such a way that the required purity is maintained throughout the operating time.
