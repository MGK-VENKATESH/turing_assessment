Further safety functions, such as safeguarding of access to the palletizer station or the start/restart interlock, are not dealt with in detail below. 176 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS F1 F3 F2 F4 K4 Functional description • A triple-beam light barrier (ESPE) F5 of Type 4 to IEC 61496 safeguards the access to the discharge point of the pal- letizer station. The light barrier embodies the additional functions of start interlock and restart interlock, which are implemented by means of two antivalent inputs. Disabling of the start interlock of the light barrier is coupled to the start command for the belt drive, i.e. energization of the palletizer station, and is initiated by picking-up and subse- quent dropping-out of the contactor relay K1 in response to actuation and release of the start button S1. A condition for a valid start command is that the contactor relays K2 and K3 have dropped out (queried via input I1.1) and that the start interlock has been cancelled (queried via input I1.0). Output O1.1 is set as a result. • Four infrared light sensors F1 to F4 (for
