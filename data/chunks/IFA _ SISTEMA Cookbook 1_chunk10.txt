The test channel G2- K1-Q1 thus detects faults in B0 and T1/G1 and brings about the safe state; Category 2 is thus met. Note: Reasonable fault detection is also a requirement for Categories 3 and 4. Conversely, Category 2 subsystems lack a redundant functional channel. SISTEMA Cookbook (Version 1.0) - 13 - 3 From the schematic circuit diagram to the safety-related block diagram Step 6a: Adding the test channel of the block The components of the test channel which detect failure of the block and bring about the safe state are presented in the safety-related block diagram as test blocks as shown in Table 1 (Category 2) If components are entered in the test channel, a major basic criterion for Category 2 is met: the safety function must be tested at suitable intervals. This causes the loss of the safety function to be detected and a safe state to be brought about by an independent disconnect- ing device. A further important requirement for Category 2 is the test frequency (see BGIA Report 2/2008e, Section 6.25). However this is not relevant to the structural analysis. Step 7: Is the component "well-tried"? Redundancy or testing was not found in the example. Only Category 1 or Category B are therefore possible. Should the component in the block under analysis be a "well-tried" com- ponent to EN ISO 13849, the block is presented as part of a Category 1 subsystem. A list of well-tried components can be found in EN ISO 13849-2. If not, the block is part of a Category B subsystem. Step 8: Have all blocks been analysed? If further blocks still await analysis following assignment of the block to a subsystem, the pro- cedure on the diagram is repeated with the next block, beginning at Step 2a. The procedure otherwise continues
