for SRP/CS • Data transfer from the MPC to the logic control is safe in accordance with GS-ET-26/IEC 61784-3. The data commu- nications protocol employed contains redundant messages with comparison between K3 and K4, and measures for detection of the following transmission errors: repetition, loss, insertion, incorrect sequence, corruption, delay and masquerade (see also subclause 6.2.18). The residual error rate Λ is lower than 1 · 10-8 per hour and thus con- tributes, as specified in the assessment standards, less than 1% towards the maximum permissible probability of failure of the safety function. Modelling is in Category 4; the resulting component in the calculation of the overall probability of failure is negligible. Remarks • An emergency motion function of the earth-moving machine, which is not shown here, may be required; if so, it must be implemented at a higher level. Calculation of the probability of failure • The multi-purpose control S1 is a commercial safety component. The associated probability of failure is added at the end of the calculation (PFH = 3.0 · 10-7 per hour [E]). For the remaining part of the control system, the probabi- D lity of failure is calculated below. • MTTF of data communication: an MTTF of 11,416 years [D] is assumed for the bus transceivers K1 and K2. This is D D capped in Category 4 to the maximum value of 2,500 years. • DC of data communication: DC = 99% for K1 and K2 by cross monitoring of the messages in the microcontrollers avg K3 and K4. • The calculated probability of failure of data communication is a PFH of 9.1 · 10-10 per hour. D • Adequate measures against common cause failure (65 points): separation (15), overvoltage protection (15) and environmental conditions (25 + 10). This analysis also applies to the downstream
