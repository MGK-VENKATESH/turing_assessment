hinders detection by the ESPE and the dangerous movement is not stopped. 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 73 Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION Preventing mutual interference from AOPDs If several AOPDs are operated in close proximity to each other, the sender beams from a system (S1) can affect the receiver of another system (R2). There is a danger that the affected AOPD will lose its ability to provide protection (see figure 51). Assembly situations of this kind must be avoided. If this is not possible, suitable measures must be taken to prevent mutual interference (assembly of opaque partitions or reversing the direction of transmission of a system, for example). Type 4 AOPDs either have to have suitable external sender detection and change to a safe state (outputs in OFF state) when affected or have technical means to Figure 51: Mutual interference impedes detection by the prevent interference. Beam coding is normally used so ESPE (S2-R2) and the dangerous movement is not stopped. that the receiver only responds to light beams from the assigned (identically coded) sender (see figure 52). Figure 52: No mutual interference of protective devices due to the use of light beam coding – person is reliably detected and the hazardous movement is stopped. Figure 53: No mutual interference of protective devices due to suitable arrangement of the machine or ESPE systems Selection of a suitable ESPE Criteria can include: • Specifications from harmonized standards, in particular type-C standards • The space available in front of the hazardous area • Ergonomic criteria, e.g., machine loading and unloading cycles 74 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION • Resolution • Response time • Ambient
