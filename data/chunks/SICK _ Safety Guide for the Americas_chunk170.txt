effects analysis 9 A dual-channel system with HFT1 can claim SILCL3 with an been examind to establish sources of common cause failure SFF of 90%. and have predetermined sources of common cause failure been eliminated by design? Are field failures analyzed with feedback into the design? 9 Competence/training Do subsystem designers understand the causes and conse- 4 quences of common cause failures? Environmental control Are the subsystem elements likely to operate always within 9 the range of temperature, humidity, corrosion, dust, vibration, etc. over which it has been tested, without the use of external environmental control? Is the subsystem immune to adverse influences from electro- 9 magnetic interference up to and including the limits specified in Annex E?

As the contactors are positively guided, a safety-relevant failure of the contactors can be detected (EDM). The logic unit UE410 is itself not part of the “actuator” subsystem, but it is used for diagnostics purposes. 1 UE410 1 Contactors 2) Definition of hardware fault tolerance (HFT) Subsystem element 1: Single-fault safety (with fault detection) results in an HFT of 1. λD1,DC1 Common Diagnostics cause failure β Subsystem element 2: λD2,DC2 3) Determining the PFHd 1 0.1×C λ = = 3 a) Based on the fault rate λ D D MTTF d B 10d 3 As contactors are subject to wear, the B value and the estimated 10d d switching frequency must be used to calculate the switching frequency d per hour
