Suitable conversion formulae (but not base failure occasions it may be necessary for several failure modes rates) can be found in [7]. that are characterized by different but equally harmful block behaviour to be considered (e.g. continuous ener- gization and oscillation on the output). The simplest solu- tion is therefore to describe the dangerous failure mode in terms of the loss of the function blockâ€˜s safety-related functionality. Diagnostics features are considered later and will be ignored at this stage. In the example under consideration here (light barrier, Figure B.2), the output voltage of the function block is to drop to zero for as long as the phototransistor K1 fails to receive light from the LED P1, since this constitutes the contribution of this function 254 Annex B B.2.4 Production of an FMEA on a function- employed is reflected in variation in the overhead associ- block basis for quantification purposes ated with generation of the tables required. One possible execution is shown by way of example in [8]. Binding rules In the FMEA, the components of the function block are do not exist. The variant shown in Figure B.3 represents first assessed separately, and the complete assessment a compromise between a high degree of accuracy and for the block is then derived from them. For practical corresponding overhead on the one hand and excessive purposes, a table documenting both the process and the simplification on the other, and takes the accuracy and results is employed.

The figures performance of the FMEA may be varied; the accuracy used are assumed example values. 255 reirrab thgiL :kcolb noitcnuf eht fo noitpircseD 1K rotsisnartotohp eht
