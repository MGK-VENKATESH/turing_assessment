This is designed to be movable (ergonomics). A spacer ring ensures that the safety distance from the hazardous point is main‐ tained. The following basic principles apply to all types: • It shall be ensured that both hands are used. • Releasing one of the two controls stops the dangerous function. • Accidental actuation must be prevented. • It is not possible to simply bypass the two-hand control device. • It must not be possible to take the two-hand control device into the hazardous area. For type II and type III two-hand control devices, the following also apply: • A new function may only be initiated after both controls have been released and then actuated. For type III two-hand control devices, the following also apply: • A function may only be initiated if both controls have been actuated synchronously within 0.5 seconds. Sub-types with detailed control-related requirements are defined for type III two-hand control devices. The most important sub-types are: • Type III A: PLc or SIL 1 • Type III B: PLd or SIL 2 with HFT1 • Type III C: PLe or SIL 3 with HFT1 NOTE HFT1: see "Hardware fault tolerance (HFT)", page 140 NOTE - Requirements on two-hand control devices: ISO 13851 (Type-B standard) NOTICE - Calculation of the minimum distance for two-hand control devices see "Approaches to calculating the minimum distance", page 100 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 85 Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION Enabling devices Enabling devices are control switches which the opera‐ tor can use to purposely enable a machine function. Generally, pushbuttons or foot switches are used as enabling devices. Having proven their worth in indus‐ trial applications, 3-position enabling devices are to be recommended. • Position 1, not actuated Execution
