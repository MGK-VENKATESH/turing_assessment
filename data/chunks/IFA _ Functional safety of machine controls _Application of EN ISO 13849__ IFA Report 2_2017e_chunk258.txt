to the FI via Q1 are not considered in the calculation of the probability of failure of the safety function. • The FI T1 with STO is available for purchase as a safety component; its probability of failure is added at the end of the calculation (1.5 · 10-8 per hour [M]). The stop function of the FI is modelled in the first channel of the block diagram (T1stop). The FI with STO would in fact be modelled in the second channel of the block diagram; a model with a turnkey safety component including PFH in a single channel is however not covered by the standard. The D FI T1 and its STO function are therefore considered as a single subsystem. This estimation therefore errs on the safe side. 169 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS Safe stop initiated by the emergency stop device S4: • MTTF : the following MTTF values are estimated: 50 years for K4 and 100 years for the stop function T1stop of D D the FI [E]. At a B value of 100,000 cycles [S] each and an n of 12 cycles per year, the MTTF for S4.1 and S4.2 is 10D op D 83,333 years. At a B value of 400,000 cycles [S] and at 240 working days, 8 working hours and a cycle time of 10D 6 minutes, the n for K1 is 19,200 cycles per year and the MTTF 208 years. At a B value of 400,000 cycles [S] and op D 10D actuation once daily on 240 working days, the MTTF for K2 is 16,667 years. The capacitor C1 is considered in the D calculation with an MTTF of 45,662 years [D]. These values yield a symmetrized MTTF of each channel of 72 years D D (“high”). • DC : fault detection
