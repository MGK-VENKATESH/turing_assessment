[M], K1: PFH = 2.5 · 10-9 per D D hour [M]). For the hydraulic part of the control system, the probability of failure is calculated as shown below. • MTTF : values of 150 years [M] are assumed for the valves 1V3 to 1V5. Overall, this results in a symmetrized MTTF D D value of 88 years (“high”) for the two channels. • DC : a DC of 99% for 1V4 is produced by direct monitoring in K1 with the aid of the position monitor 1S3. Owing to avg the close coupling of 1V3 and 1V4, this results in 1V3 being monitored indirectly at the same time with a DC of 99%. The DC of 60% for 1V5 is based upon fault detection in the process with cyclical actuation. Averaging thus produces a DC of 86% (“low”). avg • Adequate measures against common cause failure (90 points): separation (15), diversity (20), FMEA (5), overvol- tage protection etc. (15) and environmental conditions (25 + 10) • The combination of the control elements in the hydraulic part satisfies Category 3 with a high MTTF per channel D (88 years) and low DC (86%). This results in an average probability of dangerous failure of 6.2 · 10-8 per hour for avg the hydraulic system. • Altogether, the average probability of dangerous failure PFH is (8.0 + 0.25 + 6.2) · 10-8 per hour = 1.4 · 10-7 per hour.
