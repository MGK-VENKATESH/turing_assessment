(International Electrotechnical Commission) The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) is a global organization that pre‐ pares and publishes international standards in the area of electrical technology (e.g., electronics, communications, electromagnetic compatibility, power generation), and related technologies. Types of standards There are three types of standards: Type-A Type-A standards, also called basic safety standards, contain basic terminology, principles of design and general aspects that can be applied to all machinery. Type-B Type-B standards, also called generic safety standards, address a safety aspect or protective device that can be used for a wide range of machinery. Type-B standards are in turn divided into: • Type-B1 standards on specific safety aspects, e.g., the electrical safety of machinery, the calculation of safety distances, requirements for control systems • Type-B2 standards on protective devices, e.g., two-hand control devices, physical guards and electro-sensitive protective equipment Type-C Type-C standards contain all safety requirements for a specific machine or a type of machine. If this standard exists, it has priority over the type-A or type-B standard. A type-C standard may, however, refer to a type-B or type-A standard. In all circumstances the requirements of the Machinery Directive shall be met.
