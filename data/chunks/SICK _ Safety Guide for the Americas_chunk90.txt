the hazardous movement is not stopped. Installation situations of this kind must be avoided. If this is not possible, suitable measures must be taken to prevent mutual interference (assembly of opaque partitions or reversing the direction of transmission of a system, for example). Type 4 AOPDs either must have suitable external sender detec- tion and change to a safe state (outputs in OFF state) when af- fected or have technical means to prevent interference. Beam 3 coding is normally used so that the receiver only responds to light beams from the assigned sender (coded the same, see c The person is detected reliably and the dangerous movement is stopped. figures). Reflection impedes detection by the ESPE and the hazardous movement is not stopped. No mutual interference of protective devices due to the use of light beam coding – person is reliably detected and the hazardous movement is stopped. Accordingly, a minimum distance a must be maintained between all reflective surfaces and objects (e.g., containers, reflective floors) and the protective field of the system (see table "Main differences of type 2 and type 4 AOPDs according to IEC 61496"g 3-30). This minimum distance a depends on the distance D between sender and receiver (protective field width). The minimum dis- tance must be maintained on all sides of the protective field. Preventing mutual interference from AOPDs If several AOPDs are operated in close proximity to each other, the sender beams from a system (S1) can affect the receiver of another system (R2). There is a danger that the affected AOPD will lose its ability to provide protection (see figure).
