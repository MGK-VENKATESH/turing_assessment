active parts connected to main earthing rail NOTE - Protection classes: IEC 60364-4-41 - Safety of transformers: EN 61558-x Protective measures/enclosure ratings The enclosure ratings describe the protection of a component against the ingress of water (not steam) and foreign objects (dust). In addition, they describe protection against direct contact with live parts. This protection is always required, even at low voltages. All parts that remain live after the isolation of the power shall be designed to at least enclosure rating IP 2x, control cabinets shall be designed to at least enclosure rating IP 54. 34 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 2 SAFE DESIGN (INHERENTLY SAFE DESIGN) Table 10: Overview of protection classes according to IEC 60529 15° 1st digit: 2nd digit: Protection against ingress Protection against ingress of water (no steam, no other liquids!) of solid foreign bodies IP ...0 IP ...1 IP ...2 IP ...3 IP ...4 IP ...5 IP ...6 IP ...7 IP ...8 IP ...9K No Dripping water Spraying Spraying Jet Jet Immersion 100 bar, protection water water water water, 16 l/min., vertical at an angle heavy temporary continuous 80 °C IP 0...
