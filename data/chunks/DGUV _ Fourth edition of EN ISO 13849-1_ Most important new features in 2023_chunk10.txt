Fourth Edition of EN ISO 13849-1 (July 2023) 6 / 12 6.6 Subsection 6.1.9: Alternative procedure to determine the PL and PFH without MTTF D The alternative procedure introduced for the output part of an SRP/CS in the previous edition of the standard has now been modified and extended to include the input and logic parts. At the same time, it has been limited in its application: It continues to apply to subsystems containing mechanical, (electro-)hydraulic and (electro-)pneumatic components for which no reliability data is available. Now, however, it only applies if it is impossible to use the good engineering practice method provided in Annex C.2 of the standard. The familiar procedure for the output part (energy transfer elements) is now also applicable to the input part. However, an additional requirement in Categories 2, 3 and 4 is that, like in Category 1, only well-tried components are permitted. The alternative use of proven in use components has been omitted. A new approach has been added for the logic part: Category B, 2 and 3 subsystems may use an estimated value of ten years for the MTTF of each channel. In Category 1, this estimate has been D increased to 30 years, as well-tried components are required. This method is not permitted for logic subsystems in Category 4. The achievable maximum is PL c. 6.7 Subsection 6.1.10: Fault consideration and fault exclusion The previous section 7 of the standard on fault considerations and fault exclusions has now been moved to subsection 6.1.10 and has been given a more detailed introduction. In addition, a restriction is mentioned that was previously only known from ISO/TR 23849 [2]: A PL e for subsystems must not be based on fault exclusions alone. 6.8 Subsection 6.2: Combination of
