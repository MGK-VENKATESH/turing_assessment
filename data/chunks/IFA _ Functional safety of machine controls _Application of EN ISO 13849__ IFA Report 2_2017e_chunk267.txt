closed again. The installation can be restarted only by disabling of the restart interlock, i.e. by deliberate actuation and release of the start button S1. • For starting or restarting as intended, for example following a fault on the installation, the key switch S3 must be actuated. In the event of an outage, the operator can eject a pallet from the detection zone of the light barrier and the muting sensors by means of the hold-to-run button S4. For smooth progress of the pallets through the discharge opening, two time settings in the PLC program must be matched to the velocity of the transport movement: – The time setting T1 determines the maximum period within which – following activation of the sensor F1 – the sensor F2 must be activated and the muting function thus initiated by the transported product. – Time setting T2 begins with renewed clearing of the sensor F2. T2 must be selected such that when the detection zone of the light barriers becomes clear again, K1 is energized and de-energized again before sensor F3 is deacti- vated by the transported product and the muting function thereby terminated. • Failure of the contactor relays K2 and K3 to drop out is detected at the latest before the belt drive/the palletizer station start up again, owing to the feedback of the mechanically linked break contacts to the PLC input I1.1. Failure of K1 is detected at the next discharge of a pallet. • Unintended start-up of the belt drive/palletizer station by themselves in the event of the loss and subsequent restoration of power or a failure of the standard PLC is prevented by the function of the start-up and restart inter- lock. The PLC can disable the restart interlock only immediately after the pallet has passed the light
