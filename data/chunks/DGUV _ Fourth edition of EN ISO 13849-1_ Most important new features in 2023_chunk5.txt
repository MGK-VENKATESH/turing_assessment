between demanding the safety function and achieving the safe state, • operating modes in which the safety function must be active, • interfaces of the safety function with the machine control system and with other safety functions, • if necessary, a description of the failure response, i.e. how the machine can be returned to a safe state after a fault has been detected in a functional channel, • behaviour of the machine in the event of energy loss, e.g. a requirement for non-return valves directly on a cylinder or additional mechanical brakes (separation into two safety functions is also possible – one with available energy or a second one without available energy), • demand rate for the safety function, • prioritisation of different safety functions that can be enabled at the same time and can trigger conflicting responses, • additional safety requirements from product standards (type-C standards), • conditions permitting a restart after the safety function has been requested. Further guidance on this topic can also be found in SISTEMA Cookbook 6 [5]. What follows is the familiar additional requirements for special safety functions, such as a safety- related stop function, a manual reset function, etc. Regarding a manual reset, the authors clarify that a monitored signal change is required in order to avoid foreseeable misuse. In practice, this means that a falling or rising signal edge is suitable for triggering a manual reset. As the response time now needs to be specified in general terms, it is no longer required as a separate item. As a new element, the standard specifies additional requirements for the selection of the operating mode, with a view to preventing any negative impacts on other safety functions. If operating mode selection enables or disables safety functions, it is treated as a safety function in
