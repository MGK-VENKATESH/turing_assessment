application factors of severity of injury, frequency of exposure and possibility of avoidance are input. The output is the PLr. Users of the old EN 954-1 will be familiar with this approach but take note that within (EN) ISO 13849-1 the S1 line now subdivides whereas the old risk graph did not. The 2015 version provides the possibility for decreasing the PLr by one level in some circumstances depending on the foreseeable probability of occurrence. 68 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 System Design According to (EN) ISO 13849 Categories P1 a F1 B 1 2 3 4 P2 S1 P1 b S1 F2 P2 P1 Start P1 c F1 F1 S2 P2 P2 P1 d S2 P1 F2 P2 e F2 Risk Graph from Annex A of P2 (EN) ISO 13849-1 Risk Graph from Annex B of EN 954-1 So now we have a description of the safety functionality and the required performance level [PLr] for the safety-related parts of the control system [SRP/CS] that will be used to implement this functionality. We now need to design the system and verify that it complies with the PLr. One of the signifi cant factors in the decision on which standard to use [(EN) ISO 13849-1 or EN/IEC 62061] is the complexity of the safety function. In most cases, for machinery, the safety function will be relatively simple and (EN) ISO 13849-1 will be the most suitable route. Reliability data, diagnostic coverage [DC], the system architecture [Category], common cause failure and, where relevant, requirements for software are used to assess the PL. This is a simplifi ed description meant only to give an overview. It is important to understand that all the provisions given in the body of the standard must be applied. However, help is at hand.
