measure. Possible interfaces for the implementation of safety sub-functions integrated directly in the drive are: • Discrete 24-V signals • Control communication (channel 1)/24 V discrete (channel 2) • Safe communication systems (field-bus systems/network interface) In control communication, a setpoint for speed or position is transmitted from the standard controller to the drive; via a non-safety fieldbus or a network. The majority of safety sub-functions for variable speed drives available today are specified in the harmonized standard IEC 61800-5-2 “Adjustable speed electrical power drive systems”, Part 5-2 “Safety requirements – Functional safety”. Drives that meet this standard can be used as safety-related parts of a control system in accordance with ISO 13849-1 or IEC 62061. 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 121 Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION Safety functions of servo drives according to IEC 61800-5-2 Table 49: Safety functions of servo drives according to IEC 61800-5-2.
