5 Competence/Training 5 6 Environmental 35 Scoring for Common Cause Failure 82 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 System Design According to (EN) ISO 13849 A suffi cient number of these measures must be implemented in the design of a system or subsystem. It could be claimed, with some justifi cation, that the use of this list alone may not be adequate to prevent all possibility of CCF. However, if the intent of the list is properly considered it becomes clear that the spirit of its requirement is to make the designer analyse the possibilities for CCF and to implement appropriate avoidance measures based on the type of technology and the characteristics of the intended application. Use of the list enforces consideration of some of the most fundamental and effective techniques such as diversity of failure modes and design competencies. The IFA SISTEMA tool also requires the implementation of the standard’s CCF look up tables and makes them available in a convenient form. Systematic Faults We have already discussed quantifi ed safety reliability data in the form of MTTF D and the probability of dangerous failure. However this is not the whole story. When we referred to those terms we were really thinking about failures that appear to be random in nature. Indeed IEC/EN 62061 specifi cally refers to the abbreviation of PFH as the probability of random hardware failure. But there are some types of D failures collectively known as “systematic failure” that can be attributed to errors committed in the design or manufacturing process. The classic example of this is an error in software code. The standard provides measures in Annex G to avoid these errors [and therefore the failures]. These measures include provisions such as the use of suitable materials and manufacturing techniques, reviews, analysis and computer simulation. There are
