to know the d The structure for the component(s) in the block is assessed average number of cycles per year that the component will to determine the category (B, 1-4) it corresponds to. For execute. category 4, for example, individual failures do not result in With a B =2Â·106 this gives a MTTF =1,141 year which 10d d any loss of the safety function. corresponds to MTTF =high. d In order to achieve category 4 with contactors, you need Note that when you calculate MTTF you have to calculate d to have two channels - i.e., two contactors - that can cut the according to the total number of cycles the component will power to the machine individually. The contactors need to be working. A typical example of this is the contactors that be monitored by connecting opening contacts to a test input frequently work for several safety functions simultaneously. on, for example a safety relay. For monitoring of this type This means that you must add the number of estimated to work, the contactors need to have contacts with positive cycles per year from all the safety functions that use the opening operation. contactors. When MTTF is calculated from a B -value, also consider Diagnostic Coverage (DC) d 10d that if the MTTF -value is less than 200 years, the A simple method to determine DC is explained in Appendix d component needs to be replaced after 10 % of the MTTF - E in EN ISO 13849-1. It lists various measures and what they d value (due to the T -value). That is, a component with correspond to in terms of DC. For example, DC=99 % (which 10d MTTF = 160 years needs to be replaced after 16 years in corresponds to DC high) is achieved for a
