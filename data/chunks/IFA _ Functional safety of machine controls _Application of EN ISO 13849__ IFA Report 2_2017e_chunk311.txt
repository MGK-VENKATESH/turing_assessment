pushbuttons are released and pressed again synchronously. Functional description • Actuation of the two-hand control (THC) S1 and S2 initiates the hazardous movements (processing cycle) of the clamping bar (hydraulic) 1A and of the knife (electromechanical). If, during this cycle, either of the pushbuttons S1 or S2 is released or a signal change occurs in the peripheral system of the machine (e.g. light curtain, not shown on the diagram) that is not expected by the control system, the cycle is stopped and the machine remains in this safe state. Owing to their immediate physical proximity to each other, the knife and the clamping bar constitute a common hazard zone. The hazard occurs cyclically. The knife is driven by an eccentric drive that draws its energy from a flywheel mass in constant motion. The drive is not shown explicitly. The clamping bar is driven linearly by a hydraulic arrangement employing a pump connected to the drive of the flywheel mass. • When pushbuttons S1/S2 (THC) are pushed, the signal change is communicated to the two microcontrollers K1 and K2. Provided these signals satisfy the requirements for simultaneity in accordance with the standard (EN 574, Type III C) and all peripheral signals satisfy the condition for a start, K1 and K2 set the outputs for a valid cut request. Each microcontroller monitors both hazardous movements through the contactor relays K3 to K6. The closing movement of the clamping bar 1A can be prevented by the two hydraulic valves 2V1 and 2V2. Actuation of the brake/clutch combination (BCC) Q1 can be prevented via K3 and K5. A suitably dimensioned mechanical knife locking device Q2 must also be enabled cyclically by K2. Should faults be detected in Q1, the knife cycle can there- fore be prevented in the following cycle at the latest. •
