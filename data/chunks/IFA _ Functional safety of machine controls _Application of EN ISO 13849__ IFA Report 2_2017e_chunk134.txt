This can be inferred from examples: subclause 7.4.3, “Synthesis of elements to achieve the 71 6 Design of safe control systems required systematic capability”, of IEC 61508-2 [48]. In system, beginning with an initiating event through to the case of Category 2, only the requirements upon the attainment of the safe state. In reality however, it is often SRASW of the test channel can be lowered.
