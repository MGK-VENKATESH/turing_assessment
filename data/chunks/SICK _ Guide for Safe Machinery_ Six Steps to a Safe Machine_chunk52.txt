The SIL implemented depends on the structure of the control system, the reliability of the components used, the ability to detect faults as well as the resistance to multiple common cause faults in multiple channel control systems. In addition, further measures to avoid design faults are required (see "Safety-related aspects of subsystems", page 56). Summary: Determining the required level of safety General • Define the necessary level of safety for each safety function. • The parameters “severity”, “probability of occurrence” and “probability
