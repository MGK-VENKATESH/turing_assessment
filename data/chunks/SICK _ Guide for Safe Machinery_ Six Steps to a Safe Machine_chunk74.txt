In general, the detection capability is determined from the sum of the beam separation and effective beam diameter. This ensures that an object of this size always covers a light beam and is always detected regardless of its position in the protective field. For safety laser scanners (AOPDDR), the detection capability is dependent of the distance to the object, the angle between the individual beams of light (pulse), and the shape and size of the transmitted beam. The reliability of the detection capability is determined by the type classification in the IEC 61496 series of standards (see table 28, page 75). Preventing reflections from AOPDs For AOPDs, the light beam is focused from the sender. The aperture angle of the lens is reduced as far as possible so that disturbance-free operation can even be ensured in the event of minor alignment errors. The same applies to the aperture angle of the receiver (effective aperture angle according to IEC 61496-2). But even for smaller aperture angles, there is the possi‐ bility for light beams from the sender to be deflected from reflective surfaces, thus leading to a failure to detect an object (see figure 49, see figure 50). Therefore, all reflective surfaces and objects (e.g. mate‐ rial containers, reflective floors) have to maintain a min‐ imum distance a from the protective field of the system Figure 49: The person is detected reliably and the dangerous (see table 28, page 75). movement is stopped. This minimum distance a depends on the distance D between the sender and receiver (protective field width). The minimum distance must be maintained on all sides of the protective field.
