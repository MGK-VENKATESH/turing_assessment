discharging electrostatic charges (paper and plastic webs) 60 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION NOTE The mechanical requirements for guards intended to contain radiation or ejected materials are generally higher than those for fixed guards intended to prevent access of persons. Damage (breakage or deformation) to a physical guard is permitted in cases in which the risk assessment determines that no hazards will result. General requirements on physical guards • Protective devices (guards) shall be designed to be adequately robust and durable to ensure they withstand the environmental conditions to be expected during operation. The properties of guards shall be maintained during the entire period of use of the machines. • They shall not cause any additional dangers. • It shall not be possible to easily bypass the guards or render them ineffective. • Guards shall not restrict observation of the working process more than necessary, insofar that observation is necessary. • Guards shall be firmly held in place. • They shall be fastened either by systems that can only be opened with tools, or they shall be interlocked with the dangerous movement. • As far as possible, they should not remain in the protective position if unfastened. NOTE - Physical guards: ISO 14120 - Principles for safe machine design: ISO 12100 (type-A standard) Mounting guards Guards that are not removed or opened very often or are only removed or opened for maintenance work shall be fastened to the machine frame so that they can only be removed with tools (e.g., spanner, key). The process to remove them must be similar to a mounting operation and tools must be required. Fastening elements on guards that are disassembled or removed regularly shall be designed so that
