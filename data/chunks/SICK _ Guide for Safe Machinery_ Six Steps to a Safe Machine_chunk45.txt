To reduce the required stopping time, it may be advisable to implement a stop function that complies with stop category 1 (IEC 60204-1 "Stop‐ ping", page 35). Additional safety functions may be nec‐ essary to prevent an unexpected restart. Examples: • Opening a protective door with an interlock that has no locking device • Interruption of the light beam of a safety light- beam sensor that protects against access Figure 22: Initiating a stop by a safety multibeam sensor on a pallet handling machine when a person approaches Avoiding an unexpected start-up After the “Initiating a stop” function is triggered or the machine is switched on, it should require deliber‐ ate actions to put the machine into operation. These actions include manually resetting a protective device to prepare for restarting the machine (see also section "Application of reset and restart", page 110) Examples: • Resetting a safety light curtain (see figure: blue “Reset” button) • Resetting the emergency stop device Figure 23: Avoiding the unexpected start-up by deliberate resetting the safety light curtain 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 45 Subject to change without notice 3A – DEFINING THE SAFETY FUNCTIONS Preventing start After the “Initiating a stop” function, technical meas‐ ures should be used to prevent the machine from start‐ ing or being put back into operation as long as there are persons in the hazardous area. Examples: • Use of a trapped key system: Restoration of power is only possible using the transfer key.
