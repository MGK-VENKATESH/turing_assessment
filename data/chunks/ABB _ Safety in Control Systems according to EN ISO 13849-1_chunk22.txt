(No 047, Date 05/2010) Examples of safety functions from Case Study 3 - safety PLC Pluto The risk assessment for the safety functions needed for Interlock switch B1, Eden, is to cut the power to all machines the risks associated with the robot was S2, F2, P2, which in the danger zone: resulted in PL=e. The same assessment was made for the • Robot Q1 (PFH , = 5.79·10-8) r D Q1 hydraulic press: PL=e. The assessment of the pneumatic • Hydraulic press Q2 (PFH , = 8·10-8) r D Q2 machining tool is S2, F2, P1 giving PL= d due to the fact that • Pneumatic machining tool Q3 (PFH , = 2·10-7). r D Q3 the assessment is that there is the possibility of avoiding risk. Theoretical approach If you use the practical approach the safety functions are as follows: Robot: PFH , + PFH , + PFH , = 4,5·10-9 + 2·10-9 + 5.79·10-8 = 6.44·10-8 PL e D B1 D K1 D Q1 Hydraulic press: PFH , + PFH , + PFH , = 4.5·10-9 + 2·10-9 + 8·10-8 = 8.65·10-8 PL e D B1 D K1 D Q2 Pneumatic machining tool: PFH , + PFH , + PFH , = 4.5·10-9 + 2·10-9 + 2·10-7 = 2.07·10-7 PL d D B1 D K1 D Q3 This is to be done in a similar way with other safety functions for the cell. For each safety device, you define the machines it affects, and establish the various safety functions according to this. Theoretical approach How would it have worked if you had used the theoretical approach? Would the safety function have achieved PL e? All machines: PFH , + PFH , + PFH , + PFH , + PFH , D
