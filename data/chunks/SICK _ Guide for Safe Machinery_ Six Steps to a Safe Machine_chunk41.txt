of flammable substance 100 vol. % Figure 17: Conditions for an explosive atmosphere Assessing the scope of the required protective measures To assess the scope of the required protective measures, operators/employers need to divide potentially explosive- hazardous areas into zones based on the probability of the creation of a hazardous explosive atmosphere, see the ATEX Operational Directive 1999/92/EC, Annex I. The information in the following table does not apply to mining (underground or surface). Table 14: ATEX zone definition and equipment categories for equipment group II: Equipment for use in explosive dust and gas atmospheres Zone definition For gases G Zone 2 Zone 1 Zone 0 For dusts D Zone 22 Zone 21 Zone 20 Explosive atmosphere Seldom, short duration Occasional Continuous, frequent, long duration (< 10/year) (10 -- 100 h/year) (> 1,000 h/year) Safety measure Normal High Very high Device category that can be used (ATEX) 1 II 1G/II 1D 2 II 2G/II 2D 3 II 3G/II 3D Labels Equipment must be designed, tested, and suitably marked for use in these zones in accordance with the ATEX Product Directive 2014/34/EU. 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 39 Subject to change without notice 2 SAFE DESIGN (INHERENTLY SAFE DESIGN) Table 15: Marking of equipment for use in zones with explosive atmospheres II 2G Ex ia IIC T4 Example: Marking of an item of equipment as per ATEX Temperature class Can be used at ignition temperature > 135 Â°C Explosive group Acetylene, carbon disulfide, hydrogen Protection principle i = intrinsically safe a = two-fault-safe Device category (ATEX) Can be used in zone 1 Equipment group Not for use in areas where there is a risk of firedamp Explosion protection marking NOTE - ATEX Operational Directive: 1999/92/EC - ATEX Product Directive: 2014/34/EU - Standard: EN 1127-1 Explosive atmospheres
