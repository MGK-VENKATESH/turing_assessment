initiates a safety function of its own. S1 is considered below as being representative of all the devices. S1 is evaluated in a safety module K1, which actuates two redun- dant contactor relays K2 and K3. • The signals from the emergency stop devices are read redundantly into the safety module K1 for fault detection. K1 also features internal test measures. The contactor relays K2 and K3 are also monitored in K1, by means of mechanically linked readback contacts. K2 and K3 are switched by the switch S4 at each start-up command, appro- ximately twice each month. An accumulation of more than two faults in the period between two successive actua- tions can lead to loss of the safety function. • It is not assumed that more than one emergency stop device is pressed simultaneously. • Organizational measures ensure that each emergency-stop device is actuated at least once a year. Design features • Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. Protective circuits (such as contact protection) as described in the initial paragraphs of Chapter 8 are implemented. • The emergency stop devices S1, S2 and S3 are switching devices with direct opening contacts in accordance with IEC 60947-5-1, Annex K. • The supply conductors to the switching devices are laid with protection. 206 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS S1.1 K2 K1 S1.2 K3 • The safety module K1 satisfies all requirements for Category 4 and PL e. • K2 and K3 possess mechanically linked contact elements to IEC 60947-5-1, Annex L. Remark • The emergency stop function is a complementary protective measure to EN ISO 12100 [3]. Calculation of the probability of failure • S1, S2 and S3 are standard emergency stop devices to EN ISO 13850. In the two-channel model, a
