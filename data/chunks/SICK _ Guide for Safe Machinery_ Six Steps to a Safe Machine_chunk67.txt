measures are required for freeing personnel trapped in the hazardous area. A distinction must be made between concepts for auxiliary release (using a tool) and for emergency release or escape release (without a tool), as follows: • Emergency release of a locking device Possibility of manually unlocking the locking device without tools from outside the protected area in case of emergency. A locking device with emergency release may be required, for example, to free trapped persons or to fight a fire. • Auxiliary release of a locking device Possibility of manually unlocking the locking device using a tool or a key from outside the protected area in case of malfunction. A locking device with auxiliary release is not suitable for emergency release or escape release of the locking device. • Escape release of a locking device Possibility of manually unlocking the locking device without the use of tools within the protected area in order to leave the area. Locking force required An essential criterion when selecting a locking device is the force required to hold the guard. Annex I of the ISO 14119 standard specifies the maximum force that can be applied to the most commonly used movable physical guards.
