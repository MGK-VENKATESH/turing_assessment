that are truly dangerous are the dangerous undetected ones [termed λdu] DC is expressed by the formula; DC = λdd/λd expressed as a percentage. This meaning of the term DC is common to (EN) ISO 13849-1 and EN/IEC 62061. However the way that it is derived differs. The latter standard proposes the use of calculation based on failure mode analysis but also allows the use of the simplifi ed method in the form of look-up tables as provided in (EN) ISO 13849-1. Various typical diagnostic techniques are listed together with the DC percentage that their use is deemed to achieve. In some cases rational judgment is still required, for example in some techniques the achieved DC is proportional to how often the test is performed. It is sometimes argued that this approach is too vague. However the estimation of DC can depend on many different variables and whichever technique is used the result can usually only truly be described as approximate. It is also important to understand that the tables in (EN) ISO 13849-1 are based on extensive research conducted by the IFA into the results achieved by known, actual diagnostic techniques used in real applications. In the interest of simplifi cation the standard divides DC into four basic ranges. <60% = none 60% to <90% = low 90% to <99% = medium ≥99% = high 81 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery This approach of dealing with ranges instead of individual percentage values also can be considered to be more realistic in terms of achievable accuracy. The SISTEMA tool uses the same look-up tables as the standard. As the use of complex electronics increases in safety related devices, DC becomes a more important factor. It is likely that future work on the standards will look further
