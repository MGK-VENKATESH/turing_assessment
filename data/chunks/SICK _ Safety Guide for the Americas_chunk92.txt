Hazardous point protection with finger or hand detection In the case of hazardous point protection, approach is detected very close to the hazardous point. The advantage of this type of protective device is that it allows short minimum distance and the operator can work more ergo- nomically (e.g., during loading work on a press). Access protection: Detection of a person on access to the hazard zone 3 In the case of access protection, the approach of a person is detected by detecting the body. c This type of protective device is used for protection of access to hazard zones. A stop signal is initiated if the hazard zone is entered. A person who is standing behind the protective device will not be detected by the ESPE! 7028282/2014-09-08 GUIDE FOR SAFE MACHINERY | SICK 3-33 Subject to change without notice Safeguarding (technical protective measures) Risk reduction Hazard area protection: Detection of the presence of a person in the hazard area In the case of hazard area protection, the approach of the per- son is detected by detecting the person’s presence in an area. § This type of protective device is suitable for machines on which, for example, a hazard area cannot be viewed completely from the position of the reset device. If the hazard area is entered, a stop signal is initiated and starting
