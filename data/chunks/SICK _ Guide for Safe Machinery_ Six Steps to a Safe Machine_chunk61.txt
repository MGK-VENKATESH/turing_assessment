they cannot be lost (e.g., captive screws). Other types of fastening such as quick-release fasteners, screws with knobs, knurled screws, and wing nuts are only allowed if the guard is interlocked. Allowed Not permitted Figure 41: Example: Types of fastening for physical guards Movable physical guards Movable guards that need to be opened frequently or regularly without tools (e.g., for setup work) must be functionally linked to the dangerous machine function (interlocking, locking device). The term frequent opening is used, e.g., if the guard is opened at least once during a shift. If hazards are to be expected when a guard is opened (e.g., very long stopping time), locking devices are required. 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 61 Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION Ergonomic requirements to be met by movable physical guards Ergonomic aspects are also significant during the design of protective devices. Guards will only be accepted by employees if they do not hinder setup, maintenance, and other similar activities any more than necessary. Movable physical guards must meet the following ergonomic criteria: • Easy (e.g., one-handed) opening and closing, lifting, or moving • Functional handle • Opened guards should allow convenient access. Mechanical locking of movable physical guards As far as feasible, movable physical guards must be joined to the machine so that they can be securely held in the open position by hinges, guides, etc. Positive-fit mountings are preferred. Friction mountings (e.g., ball fasteners) are not recommended due to their diminishing effectiveness (wear). Table 20: Example: Locking guards Good Possible Interlocking physical guards Physical guards must be interlocked if they have the following characteristics: • Are actuated cyclically or opened regularly (doors, flaps) • Can be removed without tools or easily (e.g., covers) • Protect against
