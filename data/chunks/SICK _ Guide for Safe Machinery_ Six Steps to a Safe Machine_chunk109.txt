dangerous assembly faults Standing behind Reaching under from a Reaching through Reaching over crouched position Take the possibility of reaching over into account If there is a possibility of reaching over the vertical protective field of an ESPE, the height b of the top edge of the protective field shall be increased or the supplement C adjusted. The relevant table from the ISO 13855 standard must be used. Some type-C standards differ from ISO 13855 in the calculation of the minimum distances. Increase height of top edge S When the height of the top edge of the protective field b CRT K×T Hazardous area is increased, in addition to the height of the hazardous area a, the supplement determined by the resolution C is also used to calculate the required height of RT the top edge of the protective field when the minimum distance remains unchanged. With the top edge of the protective field calculated at this height, it is not possi‐ b ble to reach over and into the hazard zone and a C a RO supplement is not required.

This table is used to calculate the increased height of the top edge of the protective field or the increased minimum distance.
