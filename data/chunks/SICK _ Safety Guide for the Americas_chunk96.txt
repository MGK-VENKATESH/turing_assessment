In the blanked area, the resolution capability of the ESPE is enlarged (deteriorates). Take this into account when calcu- lating the minimum distance. For fixed blanking, the blanked area is precisely defined in terms of its size and position. In the case of floating blanking, only the size of the blanked area is defined, not its position in the protective field (see figure). 7028282/2014-09-08 GUIDE FOR SAFE MACHINERY | SICK 3-37 Subject to change without notice Safeguarding (technical protective measures) Risk reduction PSDI mode It is necessary to check that no hazard to the operator can Use of the protective device to trigger the machine function arise during the work process.
