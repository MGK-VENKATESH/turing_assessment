or some other internal or external infl uences. After completion of the lockout or tagout process, the dissipation of the energy must be verifi ed. Safety Isolation Systems Safety isolation systems execute an orderly shutdown of a machine and also provide an easy method of locking off the power to a machine. This approach works well for larger machines and manufacturing systems, especially when multiple energy sources are located on a mezzanine level or at distant locations. Load Disconnects For local isolation of electrical devices, switches can be placed just prior to the device that needs to be isolated and locked out. The Bulletin 194E Load Switches are an example of a product that are capable of both isolation and lockout. Trapped Key Systems Trapped key systems are another method for implementing a lockout system. Many trapped key systems start with an energy isolating device. When the switch is turned off by the “primary” key, the electrical energy to the machine is removed from all the ungrounded supply conductors simultaneously. The primary key can then be removed and taken to a location where machine access is needed. Various components can be added to accommodate more complex lockout arrangements. Alternative Measures to Lockout Lockout and tagout must be used during servicing or maintenance of the machines. Machine interventions during normal production operations are covered by safeguarding measures such as guard door interlocking systems. The difference between servicing/maintenance and normal production operations is not always clear. 30 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety Strategy Some minor adjustments and servicing tasks, which take place during normal production operations, do not necessarily require the machine to be locked out. Examples include loading and unloading materials, minor tool changes and adjustments, servicing lubrication levels, and removing waste material. These tasks must be routine, repetitive, and integral to
