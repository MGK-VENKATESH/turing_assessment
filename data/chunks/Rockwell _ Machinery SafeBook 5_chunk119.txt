Category B, use well tried safety principles and perform the safety function in the presence of a single fault. Unlike Category 3 where an accumulation of faults can lead to the loss of the safety function, Category 4 requires performance of the safety function in the presence of an accumulation of faults. In practice this is usually achieved by having a high level of diagnostics to ensure that all relevant faults are detected before any accumulation is possible. When considering a theoretical accumulation of faults, 2 faults may be suffi cient, although 3 fault consideration may be necessary for some designs.

Monitoring of both output devices and cross monitoring is required. Category 4 has a higher diagnostic coverage than Category 3. 104 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety-Related Control Systems, Additional Considerations +V SCP K1 L1 L2 L3 Aux Ch1 K2 SCP Start Aux Stop K1 Monitoring Ch1 K2 Safety Relay Ch2 Guard OP Closed Tongue Switches Ch2 TS K1 K2 TS Motor (Hazard) Gnd Contactors Category 4 with redundant Tongue Interlock Switches Up until relatively recently, single tongue actuated interlock switches with two electrical channels have been considered for use in Category 4 circuits. In order to use a single tongue interlock in a dual channel circuit it is necessary to exclude the possible single fault failure points on the mechanical actuation tongue and switch linkage. However, the Joint Technical Report ISO TR 23849 has clarifi ed that this type of fault exclusion should not be used in PLe or SIL 3 systems. If the safety system designer prefers using tongue style interlocks, then two separate switches can be used to meet Category 4. 105 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK
