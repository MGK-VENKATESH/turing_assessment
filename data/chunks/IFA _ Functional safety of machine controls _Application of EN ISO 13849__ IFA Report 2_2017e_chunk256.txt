de-energization of the contactor relay K1 (with the use of the capacitor C1 for drop-out delay). A further shut-off path exists on the “STO1” input on T1 via the output O2 of the PLC K4: this also causes the brake Q2 to be applied. The first shut-off path is thus implemented directly by the PLC K4; conversely, the second shut-off path employs relay technology and delayed drop-out. The timer settings for O2 in the PLC program and for K1 are selected such that the machine movement is halted even under unfavourable operating conditions. 168 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS S4.1 K4 T1 Stop T1 S4.2 K2 K1 C1 • Should a “fast stop” input with a particularly short deceleration phase be available on the FI, an ESPE may be connected to it if desired, as shown on the circuit diagram. This option is not considered further below. • In the event of failure of the PLC K4, the “Start/Stop”, “STO1” or “STO2” frequency inverter inputs, the contactor relay K1 with drop-out delay or the contactor relay K2, stopping of the drive is nevertheless assured, since two mutually independent shut-off paths are always present. Failure of the contactor relays K1 or K2 to drop out is detected – at the latest before renewed start-up of the machine movement – by the feedback of the mechanically linked break-contact elements to the PLC inputs I3 and I4. Design features • Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. Protective circuits (such as contact protection) as described in the initial paragraphs of Chapter 8 are implemented. • Owing to the use of an FI with STO, the contactor Q1 is no longer absolutely essential for de-energization of the supply voltage. The FI must be suitable for ramping
