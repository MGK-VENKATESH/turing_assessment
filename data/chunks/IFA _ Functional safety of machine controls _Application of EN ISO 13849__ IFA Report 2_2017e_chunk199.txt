Functional description • Opening of the movable guard (e.g. safety guard) is detected by a proximity switch B1 that acts upon the undervoltage release of a motor starter Q1. The dropping out of Q1 interrupts or prevents hazardous movements or states. • The safety function cannot be maintained with all component failures, and is dependent upon the reliability of the components. • Removal of the protective device is detected. • B1 contains no internal monitoring measures. No further measures for fault detection are implemented. Design features • Basic safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. Protective circuits (such as con- tact protection) as described in the initial paragraphs of Chapter 8 are implemented. The closed-circuit current principle of the undervoltage release is employed as the basic safety principle. • A stable arrangement of the safeguard (safety screen) is assured for actuation of the proximity switch. • Depending upon the design of the proximity switch, bypassing of safe operation may
