a signal change (OFF state) to its output signal switching devices (OS- 1 SDs). This signals from the OSSDs are used to stop the danger- ous machine functions. The standards IEC 61496-2, UL 61496-2, ANSI B11.19, RIA TR R15.406, and CSA Z432 define safety requirements for AOPDs. Typical AOPDs include single-beam and multiple light beam safety devices and safety light curtains. AOPDs with a capabil- 2 ity to detect a body or arm and not a finger or hand are called multiple light beam safety devices. They are used to protect access to hazard zones (see figure). International standards define this as devices with a detection capability more than 40 mm, whereas North American standards define this limit as 3 more than 64 mm. Hazardous point protection using a safety light curtain c With both multiple light beam safety devices and safety light curtains, rather than all light beams being activated at the same time, they are usually activated and deactivated in rapid sequence one after the other. This increases resistance to interference from other sources of light and increases their reliability accordingly. On state-of-the-art AOPDs, there is auto- matic synchronization between sender and receiver through an optical link. By using microprocessors, the beams can be evaluated indi- vidually. This enables additional ESPE functions to be imple- mented in addition to the protective function itself (g 3-37).
