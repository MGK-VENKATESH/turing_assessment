fault: “complete failure of the brake/clutch combination”, i.e. failure to disengage when the cut enable is cancelled following initiation of a cut. The reasoning for this fault exclusion is based upon many years of experience and the design features of the brake/clutch combination with the possibility of early detection of brake wear. • The components B1 and B2/B3 are required for implementation of the measures required in EN 1010-3 for stopping and overrun of the knife. Calculation of the probability of failure • The designated architecture for Category 4 for actuation of the knife drive and the clamping bar is implemented by two independent channels as described. Since the channels are virtually identical in their arrangement and are analysed with the use of identical numerical data, symmetrization is not required. For the sake of simplification, only single-channel actuation of Q1 is assumed. The probability of failure is therefore slightly lower in practice than that calculated. • Since S1 and S2 must initiate de-energization independently of each other when released, they are connected logically in series. For this purpose, one make-contact 13-14 and one break-contact 21-22 were each assigned to a control channel. The safety-related block diagram differs substantially in this respect from the functional circuit diagram. The B value for each individual contact is employed, constituting an estimation erring on the safe side. 10D • MTTF : at 240 working days, 8 working hours and a cycle time of 60 seconds, n is 115,200 switching cycles per D op year. Owing to many years‘ experience gained in the construction of these machines, together with relevant quality records and design measures such as the defined control current (low electrical load; the mechanical durability of the contacts is the determining factor), B values of 2,000,000 switching cycles [E] each are assumed for
