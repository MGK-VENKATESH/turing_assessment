For this reason, additional safety measures shall 700 mm, and 1100 mm) allows perpendicular approach, and be applied to reduce this risk. The control device (e.g., a reset permits the operator to reach over the detection field unde- pushbutton) shall be positioned so that the entire hazard zone tected toward the hazard. This solution also allows the operator can be overseen. It shall not be possible to reach the button to stand between the hazard zone and the AOPD without being from inside the safeguarded space.
