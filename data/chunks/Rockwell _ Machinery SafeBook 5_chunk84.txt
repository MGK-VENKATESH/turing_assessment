a little more complex because some logic is also required. The safety controller itself will be fault tolerant (e.g. dual channel) internally but the overall system is still limited to single channel status because of the single limit switch and single contactor subsystems. A single channel system will fail if one of its single channel subsystems fails; it is not “fault tolerant”. Input Logic Output Subsystem Subsystem Subsystem Limit Switch 440C-CR30 Safety Contactor Dual channel safety system A dual channel [also called redundant or “fault-tolerant”] system shown above. Each subsystem has two channels and can tolerate a single fault and still provide the safety function. This safety function would need to have two failures, one in each channel before the subsystem, and therefore the system, fails. Clearly a dual channel system is less likely to fail to a dangerous condition than a single channel system. But we can make it even more reliable [in terms of its safety function] if we include diagnostic measures for fault detection. Of course, having detected the fault we also need to react to it and put the system into a safe state. The following diagram shows the inclusion of diagnostic measures achieved by monitoring techniques. 71 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery Input Logic Output Subsystem Subsystem Subsystem Monitoring Monitoring Monitoring Limit Switch 440C-CR30 Safety Contactor Diagnostics with a dual channel safety system It is usually [but not always] the case that the system comprises two channels in all its subsystems. Therefore we can see that, in this case each subsystem has two “sub channels”. The standard describes these as “blocks”. A two channel subsystem will have a minimum of two blocks and a single channel subsystem will have a minimum of one block. It is possible that some systems will
