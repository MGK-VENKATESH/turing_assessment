lifting, or moving Good Acceptable • Handle to suit function • Opened guards should allow convenient access Interlocking of guards Guards must be interlocked if they: • Are actuated cyclically or opened regularly (doors, flaps) • Can be easily removed without tools (e.g., covers) or • Protect against a potentially serious hazard “Interlocking” means that the opening of the guard is converted into a control signal that stops the hazardous machine function. Guards are normally interlocked using position switches. The interlocking of a guard should fulfill the following functions: • The hazardous machine functions cannot be initiated with the guard open/missing (preventing starting) • The hazardous machine functions are stopped when the guard is opened/removed (initiating a stop) 3-20 GUIDE FOR SAFE MACHINERY | SICK 7028282/2014-09-08 Subject to change without notice Risk reduction Safeguarding (technical protective measures) There are four types of interlocking devices associated with guards as described in ISO 14119: Designation Actuation Actuator SICK product Principle Example Principle Examples Example Switching cam i10P Type 1 Not coded Turning lever i10R Physical Mechanical contact, force, pressure Hinge i10H Shaped actuator (switching rod) i16S Type 2 Coded Key – Inductive Suitable ferromagnetic materials IN4000 Magnetic Magnets, electromagnets MM12 1) 3 Type 3 Capacitive Not coded All suitable materials CM18 1) c Electro- Ultrasonic All suitable materials UM12 1) sensitive Optical All suitable materials WT 12 1) Magnetic Coded magnet RE11 Type 4 Coded RFID Coded RFID transponder TR4 Direct Optical Coded optical actuator – 1) These sensors are not designed for safety applications. If they are used in interlocking devices, the designer shall give very careful consideration to systematic and common cause failures and take additional measures accordingly. Type 3 interlocking devices should only be used if the risk assessment shows that manipulation is not foreseeable or additional measures have
