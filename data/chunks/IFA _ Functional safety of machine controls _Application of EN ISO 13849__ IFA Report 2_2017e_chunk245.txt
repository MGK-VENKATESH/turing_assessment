readback in K1 is not necessary, since a demand for the emergency stop function is much less frequent. A part of the faults in T1 are detected by the process. A small number of faults are not detected by the controller. • Organizational measures ensure that the emergency-stop device is actuated at least once a year. Design features • Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. Protective circuits (such as contact protection) as described in the initial paragraphs of Chapter 8 are implemented. • A stable arrangement of the guards is assured for actuation of the position switches. • The emergency stop device S1 with the direct opening contacts S1.1 and S1.2 satisfies EN ISO 13850. • The contacts of the position switches B2 and B3 have direct opening action in accordance with IEC 60947-5-1, Annex K. • The supply conductors to the position switches B1, B2 and B3 are laid separately or with protection. • The contactor Q1 possesses mirror contacts in accordance with IEC 60947-4-1, Annex F. 157 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS • The safety modules K1, K2 and K3 satisfy all requirements for Category 4 and PL e. • The frequency inverter T1 has no integral safety function. Remarks • The emergency stop function is a complementary protective measure to EN ISO 12100 [3]. Calculation of the probability of failure • Each of the three safety functions can be presented in three subsystems. The safety-related block diagram shows the safety-related stop function by way of example for one of the safeguards, since only one guard is opened at any given time. A comparable safety function with a virtually identical calculation of the probability of failure applies to the second guard. Reasoning must be provided for fault exclusion for
