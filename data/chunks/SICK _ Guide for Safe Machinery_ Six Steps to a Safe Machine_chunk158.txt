Summary: Verifying the safety function General • Verify that the intended safety functions conform to the required safety level. To do this, verify mechanical and functional safety. Methods • Determine the resulting level of safety as per ISO 13849-1 (PL). Available methods: Simplified method (based on PL) ° Detailed method (based on PFH values) ° D • If neither the PL nor the PFH value of the subsystem (e.g., the power control element) is known, determine D the safety level of the subsystem from the following aspects: “structure, reliability, diagnostics, resistance, and process”. • Alternatively, determine the resulting level of safety as per IEC 62061 (SIL). Here too it is possible to determine even the safety level of a subsystem that is not certified. Help Use the recommended tools and take advice. 144 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 3E – VALIDATING ALL SAFETY FUNCTIONS 3e – Validating all safety functions Validation is the checking of a theory, a plan, or a proposed solution in relation to a problem that needs to be solved. Unlike verification, where only the correct implementation of a solution in accordance with specification is assessed, validation is about the ultimate assessment of a solution in general terms with regard to its suitability to reduce risk
