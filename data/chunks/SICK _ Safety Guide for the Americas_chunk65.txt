important to channel, single channel with monitoring, dual (redundant) review the industry- or machine-specific standard appropriate channels, and dual channel with monitoring . for the application for further guidance . Examples of North American standards and technical reports which define safety performance: ➜ ANSI B11 .19, ANSI B11 .26, CSA Z432 Severity of Possibility of injury avoiding the hazard or limiting the damage Risk graph according to ISO 13849-1 The performance level is defined in five discrete steps. It de- control systems (see section ”Safety-related parameters for pends on the structure of the control system, the reliability of subsystems” g 3-15 . In addition, further measures to avoid the components used, the ability to detect faults as well as the design faults are required . resistance to multiple common cause faults in multiple channel Risk reduction Technical protective measures Safety integrity level (SIL) according to IEC 62061 The procedure used here is a numerical procedure . The extent probability of occurrence of the hazardous event is taken into of harm, the frequency/amount of time in the hazard zone, consideration . The result is the required safety integrity level and the possibility of avoidance are evaluated . In addition, the (SIL) .
