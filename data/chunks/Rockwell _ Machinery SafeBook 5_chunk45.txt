utilize the opening action of the guard to actuate. • Guardlocking Switches - In some applications, locking the guard closed or delaying the opening of the guard is required. Devices suitable for this requirement are called guardlocking interlock switches. They are suited to machines with run down characteristics but they can also provide a signifi cant increase of protection level for most types of machines. • Non-contact Interlock Switches - these devices require no physical contact to actuate with some versions incorporating a coding function for increased resistance to tampering. • Position (Limit Switch) Interlocks - Cam operated actuation usually takes the form of a positive mode limit (or position) switch and a linear or rotary cam. It is generally used on sliding guards. • Trapped Key Interlocks - Trapped keys can perform control interlocking as well as power interlocking. With “control interlocking,” an interlock device initiates a stop command to an intermediate device, which turns off a subsequent device to disconnect the energy from the actuator. With “power interlocking,” the stop command directly interrupts the energy supply to the machine actuators. Operator Interface Devices Stop Function - In the U.S., Canada, Europe and at the international level, harmonization of standards exist with regard to the descriptions of stop categories for machines or manufacturing systems. 38 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Implementation of Protective Measures NOTE: these categories are different to the categories from ISO 13849-1. See standards NFPA79 and IEC/EN 60204-1 for further details. Stops fall into three categories: Category 0 is stopping by immediate removal of power to the machine actuators. This is considered an uncontrolled stop. With power removed, braking action requiring power will not be effective. This will allow motors to free spin and coast to a stop over an extended period of time. In other cases, material
