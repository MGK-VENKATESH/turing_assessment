Safety distance for interlocking guards For interlocked movable guards that initiate a stop, a safety S Hazard zone distance must also be observed similar to the procedure for ESPE. Alternatively, interlocks with locking mechanisms may be used to prevent access until the hazard is no longer present see section “Locking devices” - 3-24). Floor Safety distance for interlocked guards 3-60 GUIDE FOR SAFE MACHINERY | SICK 7028282/2014-09-08 Subject to change without notice Risk reduction Safeguarding (technical protective measures) Where: General calculation formula • S is the minimum distance in millimeters, measured from the nearest hazardous point to the nearest door opening point. S = (K × T) + C • K is a parameter in millimeters per second, derived from the data for the approach speeds of the body or parts of the body, usually 1600 mm/s. • T is the stopping/run-down time of the overall system in seconds. • C is a safety distance taken from the corresponding table in either ANSI B11.19 and CSA Z432, or ISO 13857 and RIA TR R15.406 (safety distance as a function of opening in guards). This is necessary if it is
