improve the life of the contacts driving the coil. For AC powered coils, the drop out time is not affected. For DC powered coils, the drop out time is increased. The increase is dependent on the type of suppression selected. Control relays and contactors are designed to switch large loads, anywhere from 0.5A to over 100A. The safety system operates on low currents. The feedback signal generated by the safety system logic device can be on the order of a few milliamps to tens of milliamps, usually at 24VDC. The safety control relays and safety contactors use gold plated bifurcated contacts to reliably switch this small current. 54 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Implementation of Protective Measures Overload Protection Overload protection for motors is required by electrical standards. Diagnostics provided by the overload protection device enhances not only equipment safety but operator safety as well. Technologies available today can detect fault conditions like an overload, phase loss, ground fault, stall, jam, under-load, current imbalance and over-temperature. Detecting and communicating abnormal conditions prior to tripping help to improve production up time and help prevent operators and maintenance people from unforeseen hazardous conditions Drives and Servos Safety rated drives and servos can be used to prevent rotational energy from being delivered to achieve a safety stop as well as an emergency stop. AC drives achieve the safety rating with redundant channels to remove power to the gate control circuitry. The redundant channels are monitored by either external or integral logic depending on the type of drive. This redundant approach allows the safety rated drive to be applied in emergency stop circuits without the need for a contactor. The Servo achieves a result in a manner similar to the AC drives using redundant safety signals are used to achieve the safety function “safe torque-off”. Connection
