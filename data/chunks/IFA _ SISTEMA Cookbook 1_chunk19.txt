Annex D: Schematic table The schematic table is an alternative method of structure analysis in accordance with Figure 5. All components shown on the schematic circuit diagram are entered in a table in accordance with the method described in Section 3. Table 4 shows the possible combina- tions and the resulting structure (possible Category) and presentation in the safety-related block diagram; Table 5 has been completed for the example in Section 3, and Table 6 pro- vides an empty form for the user's examples.

(3) Does the internal structure maintain the (safety) function? (4) Is the SF retained owing to redundant design of the SF involving other components? (5) Is the component fault detected in time and a safe state brought about?
