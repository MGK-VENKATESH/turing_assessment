strategy intended to present, in the and without separate actuator), guard-locking devices, simplest way possible, the complex interrelationship of enabling switches and pushbuttons: mechanical and electrical elements in the electromecha- nical components referred to. The focus lay here not upon • Up to PL d: fault exclusion is permissible and may also the details of the electromechanical design, but upon a apply to the mechanical aspects, subject also to con- recipe that is as simple as possible: firmation by the manufacturer. Modelling as a Category 3 encapsulated subsystem (with single-fault tolerance) • An electromechanical component employing one con- and direct statement of PL d and PFH of zero. The D tact element with direct opening action that satisfies coupling between PL and PFH must be cancelled for D the above conditions can be modelled as part of a Cate- this purpose in SISTEMA (under Subsystem, “PL” tab). gory 1 subsystem. In the functional channel, the subsys- tem contains a block with the corresponding B value. • PL e: no fault exclusion (for mechanical and electrical 10D aspects) is permissible • An electromechanical component employing (at least) two contact elements with direct opening action that For emergency stop devices in accordance with IEC 60947- satisfies the above conditions can be modelled as part 5-5, fault exclusion with respect to the “failure of contacts of a Category 3 or 4 subsystem, depending upon fault to open” is permissible for mechanical aspects up to detection in the downstream SRP/CS. In each of the two PL e, provided a maximum number of actuations is con- functional channels, the subsystem contains one block sidered. In the past, 6,050 actuations to IEC 60947-5-5 with the corresponding B value. was em ployed in this context as the number of operation 10D cycles over the lifetime. Beyond the
