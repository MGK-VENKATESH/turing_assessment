switch control currents, D B values of 20,000,000 cycles [S] and resulting MTTF values of 868 years apply to each of them. Should the 10D D re quirements be higher (longer working hours or a shorter cycle time), higher B values validated by the manu- 10D facturer may be required for K2/K3. Overall, the resulting MTTF value per channel is 41 years (“high”). D 231 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS • DC : a DC of 99% for S1 and S2 is achieved by virtue of direct monitoring with the aid of the break/make contact avg combinations in K1. The DC of 99% for K2 and K3 is based upon readback of the mechanically linked break contacts in the feedback circuit of K1. The high frequency of actuation in the application results in frequent testing (see sub- clause 6.2.14). Averaging results in a DC of 99% (“high”). avg • Adequate measures against common cause failure (70 points): separation (15), FMEA (5), overvoltage protection etc. (15) and environmental conditions (25 + 10) • The combination of the control elements satisfies Category 4 with a high MTTF per channel (41 years) and high D DC (99%). For the combination of S1, S2, K2 and K3, the average probability of dangerous failure is calculated at avg 6.7 · 10-8 per hour. If a value of 3.0 · 10-9 per hour [E] for K1 is added, the result is an average probability of dange- rous failure of 7.0 · 10-8 per hour. This satisfies PL e. The probability of failure of downstream power components may have to be added for completion of the safety function. • The wearing elements S1 and S2 should each be replaced at intervals of approximately eight years (T ). 10D More detailed references • EN 574: Safety of machinery
