(safety function "Temporarily preventing access", page 44). Locking devices shall prevent access to hazardous areas until the dangerous machine state has passed. Locking devices are also required if a process shall not be interrupted (process protection only, not a safety function). The figure below shows the possible designs of locking devices.

Mechanical and electrical integration of locking devices The same rules generally apply to locking devices as to interlocking devices. In relation to the principle of positive opening, attention is to be paid to which contacts should be positively opened. Guard signaling contacts indicate when the actuator has been withdrawn, that the guard is open. These contacts may be positive opening, but this is not always required.
