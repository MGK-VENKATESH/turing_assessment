B1 and B2 is based upon plausibility monitoring of the two switching states in K2. The DC avg of 99% for the two valves is based upon direct monitoring of the switching states by the PLC K1. This results in a DC of 99% (“high”) for the two subsystems. avg • Measures against common cause failures (75 points) for the two subsystems: separation (15), well-tried compo- nents (5), FMEA (5), protection against overvoltage etc. (15) and environmental conditions (25 + 10) • The electromechanical and hydraulic parts of the control system correspond to Category 4 with a high MTTF and a D high DC (99%). This results in an average probabilities of dangerous failure of 1.3 · 10-9 per hour and 2.1 · 10-8 per avg hour. Addition inclusive of K2 produces an average probability of dangerous failure for the complete safety function of 2.5 · 10-8 per hour. This satisfies PL e.

Functional description • A hazard zone is safeguarded by a movable guard (safety guard). Opening of the safety guard is detected by two position switches B1/B2 employing a break contact element/make contact element combination, and evaluated in a central safety module K1.
