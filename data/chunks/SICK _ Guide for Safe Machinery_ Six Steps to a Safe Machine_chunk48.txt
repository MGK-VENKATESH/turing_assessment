Within this context, different safety measures may be effective or different safety functions may be coupled together. The process of switching between operating modes, or the selection and adjust‐ ment of different safety measures, is not allowed to lead to a dangerous state. When combining or changing safety functions, an appropriate safety level must also be determined and implemented. Examples: • After a change of operating mode between setup and normal operation, the machine is stopped. A new manual start command is necessary. • Adapting the monitored area of a safety laser scanner according to the vehicle speed Figure 30: Adapting the monitored area of a safety laser scanner according to the vehicle speed Emergency stop Emergency stop is a complementary protective meas‐ ure and not a protective device. The safety level of this function shall be defined based on the risk assessment of the machine. In particu‐ lar, influencing environmental factors (e.g., vibration, method of actuation, etc.) shall be considered (see also section "Emergency operation", page 89).
