MTTF DC CCF Check D Figure 112: Aspects for determining the performance level of a subsystem Structure and category of safety-related parts of controllers Subsystems are usually single-channel or dual-channel. Unless additional measures are in place, single-channel systems respond to errors with a dangerous failure. Errors can be detected by introducing additional testing components or dual-channel systems supporting reciprocal testing.
