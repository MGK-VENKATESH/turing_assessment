the two conditions are often not met. contacts is a major factor determining the B value, as 10D is frequently confirmed by observations in the field. At What is stated in the standard? – Electro mechanical low electrical load (typically resistive load), described by components in accordance with Part 1 of the standard EN ISO 13849-1 as up to 20% of the rated value, substan- tially better values are obtained. The mechanical rather With the good engineering practice method introduced than the electrical durability was assumed decisive in above, EN ISO 13849-1:2015 proposes that subject to this case (see subclause D.2.4). Depending upon the type satisfaction of the conditions set out below, the typi- (resistive or inductive) and magnitude of the load, B cal B values [S] for position switches, guard-locking 10D 10D values lying between the extremes stated here may be devices, emergency stop devices, enabling switches and derived. For the position switches, guard-locking devices, pushbuttons stated in Table D.2 may be assumed: emergency stop devices and pushbuttons, such as ena- bling switches, listed in the table, the safety principle of • Use of basic and well-tried safety principles in design, direct opening action is generally a requirement for the application and operation of the component (see Tables electrical part. Between the second and third editions of D.1 and D.2 to EN ISO 13849-2), and the standard, certain changes took place for these com- ponents in the good engineering practice method as a result of experience gained with application in the field. 274 Annex D • The possibility of fault exclusion for direct opening and application aspects.
