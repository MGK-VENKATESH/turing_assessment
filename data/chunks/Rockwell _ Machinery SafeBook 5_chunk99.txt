application. (EN) ISO13849-2 provides examples and justifi cations for excluding certain faults for electrical, pneumatic, hydraulic and mechanical systems. Fault exclusions must be declared with detailed justifi cations provided in the technical documentation. It is not always possible to evaluate a Safety-Related Control System without assuming that certain faults can be excluded. For detailed information on fault exclusions, see ISO 13849-2. As the level of risk gets higher, the justifi cation for fault exclusion gets more stringent. In general, where PLe is required for a safety function to be implemented by a safety-related control system it is not normal to rely upon fault exclusions to achieve this level of performance. This is dependent upon the technology used and the intended operating environment. Therefore it is essential the designer takes additional care on the use of fault exclusions as that PL requirement increases. Performance Level (PL) The performance level is a discrete level that specifi es the ability of the safety- related parts of the control system to perform a safety function. In order to assess the PL achieved by an implementation of any of the fi ve designated architectures, the following data is required for the system (or subsystem): • MTTF (mean time to dangerous failure of each channel) D • DC (diagnostic coverage). • Architecture (the category) The following diagram shows a graphical method for determining the PL from the combination of these factors. The table at Annex K shows the tabular results of different Markov models that created the basis of this diagram. Refer to the table when more precise determination is needed. 84 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 System Design According to (EN) ISO 13849 a b c d e Cat B Cat 1 Cat 2 Cat 2 Cat 3 Cat 3 Cat 4 DCavgnone DCavgnone DCavglow DCavgmed DCavglow
