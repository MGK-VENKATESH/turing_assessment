or reach directly into the hazard area it is obviously necessary that the time taken for the motion to stop is less than that required for the operator to reach the hazard after tripping the device. Safety Switches When access to the machine is infrequent or when there is a possibility of part ejection, movable (operable) guards are often preferred. The guard is interlocked with the power source of the hazard in a manner which ensures that whenever the guard door is not closed the hazard power will be switched off. This approach involves the use of an interlocking switch fi tted to the guard door. The control of the power source of the hazard is routed through the switch section of the unit. The power source is usually electrical but it could also be pneumatic or hydraulic. When guard door movement (opening) is detected the interlocking switch 37 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery will initiate a command to isolate the hazard power supply either directly or via a power contactor (or valve). Some interlocking switches also incorporate a locking device that locks the guard door closed and will not release it until the machine is in a safe condition. For the majority of applications the combination of a movable guard and an interlock switch with or without guard locking is the most reliable and cost effective solution. (EN) ISO 14119 provides useful guidance on the selection of all types of guard interlocking devices. Its use is recommended. There is a wide variety of safety switch options including: • Tongue Interlock Switches - these devices require a tongue-shaped actuator to be inserted and removed from the switch for operation • Hinge Interlock Switches - these devices are placed on the hinge-pin of a guard door and
