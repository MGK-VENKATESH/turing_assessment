PL c max. PL d Category and PL assignment The following can be summarized for guard-locking D.2.5.4 Emergency stop device devices: Emergency stop devices constructed in accordance with • The B value that can be applied (to one or two chan- the IEC 60947-5-5 product standard can be considered as 10D nels) for guard-locking devices in accordance with the described in Table D.6 (see page 279). good engineering practice method is 2,000,000 cycles. D.2.5.5 Enabling switches • The existence of the faulty-closure protection and the associated fault exclusion for the mechanical part must Three-position enabling switches constructed in be confirmed by the manufacturer. accordance with the IEC 60947-5-8 product standard or the GS-ET-22E test principles [8] can be considered as • A maximum of PL d can be attained by a single guard- described in Table D.7. Enabling switches are available locking device as a modular unit for the interlock with different contact sets (different numbers of make-/ function (even with two contact elements per position break-contact elements). The safety-related cancellation switch) in accordance with EN ISO 13849-2, Table D.8. of the enabling function is attained on three-position If a PL of e is desired, it can be attained only by means enabling switches by releasing the switch or pressing it in of an external additional position switch for position fully. The two functions can be evaluated in the same way; monitoring of the safeguard. with respect to
