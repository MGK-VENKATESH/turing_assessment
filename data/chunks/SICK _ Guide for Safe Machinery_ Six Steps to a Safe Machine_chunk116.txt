of the minimum distance for interlocked physical guards: ISO 13855 (type-B standard) Required height for physical guards Similar to the procedure for ESPE, the same procedure is also to be used for physical guards. Different calculation tables are to be used depending on the potential hazard. To prevent crawling beneath physical guards, it is normally sufficient if the guards start at 180 mm above the reference level. 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 107 Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION Required height of physical guards in case of low potential hazard according to ISO 13857 C Hazardous area b a Figure 89: Parameters for determining the height requirements for guards Table 45: Required height of physical guards in case of low potential hazard according to ISO 13857 Height a of the hazard‐ Horizontal distance C to the hazardous area (mm) ous area (mm) 2,500 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2,400 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 0 2,200 600 600 500 500 400 350 250 0 0 2,000 1,100 900 700 600 500 350 0 0 0 1,800 1,100 1,000 900 900 600 0 0 0 0 1,600 1,300 1,000 900 900 500 0 0 0 0 1,400 1,300 1,000 900 800 100 0 0 0 0 1,200 1,400 1,000 900 500 0 0 0 0 0 1,000 1,400 1,000 900 300 0 0 0 0 0 800 1,300 900 600 0 0 0 0 0 0 600 1,200 500 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 400 1,200 300 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 200 1,100 200 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1,100 200 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Height b of the physical guard (mm) 1,000
