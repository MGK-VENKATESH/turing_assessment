of 20 seconds, n is 691,200 cycles per year and the MTTF is 289 years (“high”). op D This is also the MTTF value per channel. D • DC : direct monitoring of the switching states yields a DC of 99% for 1V1 and 1V2. The resulting DC is also 99% avg avg (“high”). • Adequate measures against common cause failure (65 points): separation (15), overvoltage protection etc. (15) and environmental conditions (25 + 10) • The combination of the pneumatic control elements satisfies Category 4 with a high MTTF (289 years) and a high D DC (99%). This results in an average probability of dangerous failure of 8.1 · 10-9 per hour. This satisfies PL e. Fol- avg lowing the addition of further SRP/CS in the form of subsystems for completion of the safety function, the PL may under certain circumstances be lower.
