related parts of control systems” This standard is intended to provide a direct transition path from the categories of the previous EN 954-1. 4. IEC 61511 “Functional safety - Safety instrumented systems for the process industry sector” This standard is the process sector specifi c implementation of IEC/EN 61508 The functional safety standards represent a signifi cant step beyond the familiar existing requirements such as Control Reliable and the Categories system of the previous ISO 13849-1:1999 (EN 954-1:1996). Categories have not disappeared completely; they are still used in the current (EN) ISO 13849-1. IEC/EN 62061 and (EN) ISO 13849-1 IEC/EN 62061 and (EN) ISO 13849-1 both cover safety-related electrical control systems. It is possible that they will eventually be combined into one standard with common terminology. Both standards produce the same results but use different methods. They are intended to provide users with an option to choose the one most suitable for their situation. A user can choose to use either standard and they are both harmonized under the European Machinery Directive. The outputs of both standards provide comparable levels of safety performance or integrity. The methodologies of each standard have differences that are appropriate for their intended users. The methodology in IEC/EN 62061 is intended to allow for complex safety functionality which may be implemented by previously unconventional system architectures. The methodology of (EN) ISO 13849-1 is intended to provide a more direct and less complicated route for more conventional safety functionality implemented by conventional system architectures. An important distinction between these two standards is the applicability to various technologies. IEC/EN 62061 is better suited to electrical systems. (EN) ISO 13849-1 can be applied to pneumatic, hydraulic, mechanical as well as electrical systems. Joint Technical Report on IEC/EN 62061 and (EN) ISO 13849-1 A joint report has been prepared
