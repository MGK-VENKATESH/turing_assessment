ator is closer to the work process device due to good resolution and (short paths) presence detection • Automatic start or PSDI mode possi‐ ble • Very little space required 2 Hazardous area protection • Automatic start possible • The operator is much further away S = 1,256 mm • Enables access to be protected (long paths) independent of the height of the • More space required hazardous area • Lower productivity 3 Access protection • Cost-effective solution • The operator is much further away S = 1,106 mm • Enables access to be protected (long distances) independent of the height of the • Lowest productivity (always neces‐ hazardous area sary to reset the ESPE) • Protection on several sides possible • The risk of standing behind is to be using deflector mirrors taken into account. Not to be rec‐ ommended if more than one person is working in the same location. Required protective field size/height of the ESPE As a general rule, the following faults must be excluded when assembling protective devices: • It shall only be possible to reach the hazardous point through the protective field. • In particular, it shall not be possible to reach hazardous points by reaching over/under/around. • If it is possible to stand behind protective devices, additional measures to prevent an unexpected startup are required (e.g., restart interlock, secondary protective device). Once the minimum distance between protective field and the nearest hazardous point has been calculated, the protective field height required must be determined in a further step. This ensures the hazardous point cannot be reached by reaching over. 102 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION Table 39: Examples of correct assembly of ESPE Table 40: Examples of
