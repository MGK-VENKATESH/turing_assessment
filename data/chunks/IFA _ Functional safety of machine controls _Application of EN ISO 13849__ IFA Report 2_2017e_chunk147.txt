the PL. for the practical functionality (e.g. crystal oscillator). All avg elements the dangerous failure of which could prevent performance of the safety function in the affected channel Calculation of the probability of failure must be considered. This generally encompasses all ele- ments in the signal path critical to safety, e.g. for decoup- • MTTF : at 240 working days per year, 8 working hours ling, readback, EMC protection or protection against over- D per day and a cycle time of 80 seconds, n is 86,400 voltage. These elements are generally necessary for the op cycles per year. For S1 and S2 and for K3 to K6, a B implementation of basic and well-tried safety principles or 10D value of 2,000,000 cycles [M] produces an MTTF of for attainment of the DC. Figure B.2 (see Page 253 shows D 232 years. For the microcontroller alone, an MTTF of this approach with reference to a further simple example. D 1,142 years is determined [D]. The same value is also The parts count method shown in Table 6.8 is suitable for substituted for the ASIC [D]. Together with the asso- use as a simple tabular method for determining the block ciated circuit arrangement, this results in an MTTF of MTTF based upon the element MTTF . (For comparison, D D D 806 years in each case for the blocks K1 and K2. The Figure B.3 on Page 255 shows the procedure for a failure manufacturer states an MTTF of 150 years [M] in each mode and effects analysis.) D case for the hydraulic valves 1V3, 1V4, 2V1 and 2V2. These values result in an MTTF for each channel of The failure rates for the elements stated in the second D 31.4 years (“high”). column were determined by means of the SN 29500
