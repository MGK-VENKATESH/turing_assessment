reduced to 100 years D (“high”) for the subsystem. The contactor Q1 has a limited operation time (T ) of 18 years. Its replacement in good 10D time is recommended. The MTTF for the braking device K1 was determined using the parts count method. The com- D ponent information from the parts list and the values from the SN 29500 database [48] yield an MTTF of 518 years D [D]. This is also reduced to 100 years (“high”). • DC and measures against common cause failures are not relevant in Category B and Category 1. avg • The subsystem S1/Q1 satisfies Category 1 with a high MTTF (100 years). This results in an average probability of D dangerous failure of 1.1 · 10-6 per hour. This satisfies PL c. • The subsystem K1 satisfies Category B with a high MTTF (100 years). This results in an average probability of D dangerous failure of 4.2 · 10-6 per hour. This satisfies PL b. • For the safety-related stop function, the resulting average probability of dangerous failure is 5.4 · 10-6 per hour. This satisfies PL b. 113 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS Figure 8.10: Determining of the PL by means of SISTEMA 114 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS 115 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS 8.2.5 Position monitoring of movable guards – Category 1 – PL c (Example 5) L + Open B1 Q1 Closed M Q1 3~ Figure 8.11: Position monitoring of movable guard for the prevention of hazardous movements (STO – safe torque off) Safety function • Safety-related stop function, initiated by a guard: opening of the movable guard initiates the safety function STO (safe torque off). Functional description • Opening of the movable guard (e.g. safety guard) is detected by a position switch B1 with direct opening contact, which
