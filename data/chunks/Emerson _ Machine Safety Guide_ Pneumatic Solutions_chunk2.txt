2006/42/EC (EU Machinery Regulation EU 2023/1230 starting from January 20th, 2027) on machine engineering aims to ensure a common safety level for new machines distributed and operated in the member states. It governs safety and occupational health requirements for design and engineering. The CE mark indicates that the manufacturer has achieved an adequate level of protection. Harmonized standards from the European standards organizations provide additional assistance to machine operators and manufacturers, since they enhance compliance with the Machinery Directive (EU Machinery Regulation EU 2023/1230 starting from January 20th, 2027) through what is called “presumption of conformity”. This principle, however, only applies to the legal requirements that the harmonized standards actually cover. Almost all laws worldwide mandate a risk assessment to analyze and assess risks and finally implement mitigating measures. Machine-specific standards • B1-type standards cover specific safety • A-type standards (basic safety standards) aspects(e.g. safety clearances, surface define basic concepts, terminology and temperature, noise) design principles that can be applied to • B2-type standards cover protective devices machines (e.g. two-hand circuits, guards) • B-type standards (generic safety standards) • C-type standards (machine safety standards) deal with a single safety aspect or protective contain detailed safety requirements for a device for a series of machines certain machine EN 693 EN 474 EN 1010 ISO 23125 IEC 61800-5-2 IEC 60204 Electrical equipment IEC 61508 Electronic controls ISO 4413 Legal basis Hydraulics Example: Machinery Directive IEC 62061 IEC 62061 ISO 4414 Electrical machine control Pneumatics Basic standards ISO 12100 A-type standards Risk evaluation ISO 13849 Machine control ISO 13850 Generic standards Emergency OFF device B-type standards Precedence and presumption of conformity ISO 13855 Positioning of safeguards C-type standards: product standards with respect to the approach speeds of parts of the human body 4 Machine safety | Basic conditions Hazards and risks: Estimate –
