6.4 shows which b ≥ 3 ⋅ 10-6 to < 10-5 quantifiable aspects must be considered when SRP/CSs c ≥ 10-6 to < 3 ⋅ 10-6 are used in combination. Figure 6.2 explains the need for this additional subclause. The machine control sys- d ≥ 10-7 to < 10-6 tem (CS) as a whole is divided into safety-related parts e ≥ 10-8 to < 10-7 (SRP/CS) and the non-safety-related parts; the latter are generally substantially more comprehensive and serve only to perform normal operating functions. The combi- In principle, any method (e.g. Markov calculations, Petri nation of safety-related parts of a control system begins nets) may be used to prove the probability of failure. The at the point at which safety-related signals are generated following criteria must however always be observed: (these include, for example, the actuating cam and rol- ler of a position switch), and ends at the outputs of the • Quantifiable aspects (structure, component reliability, power control elements (for example including the main diagnostics in the form of tests, common cause failure) contacts of a contactor).
