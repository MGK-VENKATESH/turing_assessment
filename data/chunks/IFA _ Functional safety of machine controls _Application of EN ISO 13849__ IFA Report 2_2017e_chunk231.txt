for PL d and the information in subclause 6.3. Remarks • DIN 56950-2, subclause 5.2.1 requires two suspension elements in order to prevent a studio hoist and its load from falling. • Visual inspections and maintenance of the suspension elements must be performed at suitable intervals. • Parts of the circuit structure as shown are not explicitly designed to prevent possible hazards resulting from un expected movement of the studio hoist. • As the calculation of the probability of failure shows, the circuit structure used attains PL d for the safety function under consideration here. Use of the risk graph to determine the required Performance Level PL with the para- r meters S2, F1 and P1 in accordance with DIN 56950-2, subclause A.1.2.3.3 results in a PL of c, provided the stu- r dio hoist is operated under supervision and only by skilled personnel. Should this not be the case, a PL of d is r required. Calculation of the probability of failure • Components are grouped into blocks in Figure 8.25 in the interests of clarity. K9 to K15 each contain one optocoup- ler and two resistances. K16 to K18 additionally each contain a transistor for driving the downstream contactor relays. • For application of the simplified procedure for estimation of the achieved PL, the components in the circuit are assigned to the blocks of the designated architecture for Category 2 as follows: I: B1 L: K10, K6, K1, K2, K16, K3, K17, K22 O: K19, K20 TE: B2, K11, K12, K9, K5, K7, K8, K4, K18, K13, K14, K15 OTE: K21 141 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS • MTTF : the MTTF values required for the calculation were sourced primarily from EN ISO 13849-1 [S], and from D D SN 29500-2 and SN 29500-14 [D].
