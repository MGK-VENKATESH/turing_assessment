principles [see annex of (EN) ISO 13849-2]. There must also be diagnostic monitoring via a functional test of the system or subsystem. This must occur at start up and then periodically with a frequency that equates to at least one hundred tests to every demand on the safety function. The 2015 amendment allows for an alternative requirement for the safety function to go to safe state before process safety time.. The system or subsystem can still fail if a single fault occurs between the functional tests but this is usually less likely than for Category 1. Note that for Category 2 used for PLd there must be two signal output devices because, in the event of a fault detection, the test output must initiate a safe state. See (EN) ISO 13849-1 for full requirements. 74 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 System Design According to (EN) ISO 13849 Wiring Wiring Input Logic Output Device Device Monitoring Cross Monitoring Wiring Wiring Input Logic Output Device Device Monitoring Designated Architecture Category 3 Designated Architecture Category 3 must use basic safety principles [see annexes of (EN) ISO 13849-2]. There is also a requirement that the system / subsystem must not fail in the event of a single fault. This means that the system needs to have single fault tolerance with regard to its safety function. The most common way of achieving this requirement is to employ a dual channel architecture as shown above. In addition to this it is also required that, wherever practicable, the single fault should be detected. This requirement is the same as the original requirement for Category 3 from EN 954-1. In that context the meaning of the phrase “wherever practicable” proved somewhat problematic. It meant that Category 3 could cover everything from a system with redundancy but no fault detection [often
