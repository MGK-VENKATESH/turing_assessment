Slaves Double static inputs that Traditional safety PLC only test the switches each Master-Slave with static inputs time they are used. Number of machines/different stops To achieve PL e using a conventional safety relay, such as achieve PL e to EN ISO 13849-1. The Vital module is based RT9, you need to use both channels on the input side and on a dynamic single-channel concept and can replace only connect a single safety device. Under certain conditions multiple safety relays. A similar solution, although more PL d can be achieved by connecting multiple two-channel flexible, is safety PLC Pluto. Pluto, like Vital, is able to make devices to a safety relay, but this is not a generally accepted use of dynamic signals to achieve maximum reliability. method. Vital is a safety controller that allows you to connect and monitor a variety of safety components in series, and to Benefits of Vital Benefits of Pluto • It is possible to connect up to 30 safety components • Pluto is an all-master-system with communications through a channel in line with PL e across a separate safety bus • No programming required • Greater flexibility facilitates the design of protection • The option of combining various safety components systems (e.g. emergency stop button and door contact) • One software for all systems • Easy configuration of the circuit • Easy programming for PL e by using function blocks • Electromechanical switches can also be used (with (certified by TÜV) the addition of the Tina adaptation device) More than 70,000 Vital systems have been More than 30,000 Pluto systems have been successfully installed. successfully installed.
