switching the machine on, specific actions are required to put the machine into operation. These actions include manually resetting a pro- tective device to prepare for restarting the machine (see also section “Application of reset and restart”g 3-64). Examples: • Resetting the emergency stop device 1 • Resetting an optoelectronic protective device (see figure: Blue “Reset” button) • Restarting the machine once all the necessary protective devices are effective Preventing start 3 After an “initiating a stop” function, technical measures prevent the machine from starting or being put back into operation as a long as there are persons in the hazard zone. Examples: • Trapped key systems • Detection in the active protective field of a horizontal safety light curtain (see figure). The “initiating a stop” function is implemented by the protective field of the vertical safety light curtain. Combination of initiating a stop/preventing start Restart is prevented using the same protective device that initi- ates the stop as long as there are people or parts of the body detected in the hazard zone Examples: • A two-hand control on single-person workplaces • Use of a light curtain so that standing behind or reaching around is not possible (hazardous point protection) • Use of a safety laser scanner for area protection (see figure) 3-4 GUIDE FOR SAFE MACHINERY | SICK 7028282/2014-09-08 Subject to change without notice Risk reduction Technical protective measures Allowing material passage To move materials in or out of the hazard zone, specific features of the materials moved are used for material detection or to automatically differentiate between material and people. The protective device is then not actuated during material transport, however, people are detected. Examples: • Selecting suitable sensors and placing them in appropriate 1 positions allows the material to be detected and the safety function is
