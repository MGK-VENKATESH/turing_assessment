Monitoring Safety Relays (MSR) Monitoring safety relay (MSR) modules play a key role in many safety systems. These modules are usually comprised of two or more positively guided relays with additional circuitry to ensure the performance of the safety function. 42 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Implementation of Protective Measures Positive guided relays are designed to prevent the normally closed and normally open contacts from being closed simultaneously. Some monitoring safety relays have safety rated solid state outputs. Monitoring safety relays perform many checks on the safety system. Upon power- up, they perform self-checks on their internal components. When the input devices are activated, the MSR compares the results of redundant inputs. If acceptable, the MSR checks external actuators connected to its outputs. If okay, the MSR awaits a reset signal to energize its outputs. Therefore a correctly selected and confi gured MSR can provide system fault detection by checking its connected input and output devices. It can also provide a start/restart interlock. The selection of the appropriate safety relay is dependent on a number of factors: the type of device it monitors, the type of reset, the number and type of outputs etc. Types of Inputs to Monitoring Safety Relays (MSR) Different types of safeguarding devices provide different types of inputs to a monitoring safety relay so it is important to check for compatibility. The following is a brief summary of the types inputs that can be expected and the required cross-fault detection characteristics. Electromechanical Interlocks, some Non-Contact Interlocks and Emergency Stops: Mechanical contacts, single channel with one normally closed contact or dual channel, both normally closed. The MSR must be able to accept single or dual channel and provide cross-fault detection
