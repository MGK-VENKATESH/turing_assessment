To safely monitor the switching state of a valve and hence the safety function performance, an electronic proximity sensor queries the slider position and sends a signal with the switching state to the machine control. The valve is not a safety device but can be used as part of a larger solution. Safety-related features • Correct sensor mounting and positioning, including all tolerances • Tamper-proof: the sensor is protected against tampering • 100% functionally tested before delivery • Can be used in the higher categories 3 and 4, max. possible performance level e • Valve increases the diagnostic coverage of a pneumatic control (99%) • High B value with 39.6 million switching cycles for ISO 1 10 • Implements basic and well-tried safety principles ISO valve Series IS12 Your advantages: • Electrically operated 5/2 directional valve with spring return according to ISO 5599-1, size
