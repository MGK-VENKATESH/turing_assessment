According to (EN) ISO 13849 Physical technology devices generally comprise components that are individually designed for their specifi c use. The components are shaped, moulded, cast, machined etc. They are combined with linkages, springs, magnets, electrical windings etc to form a mechanism. Because the component parts do not, in general, have any history of use in other applications, we cannot fi nd any pre- existing reliability data for them. The estimation of the PFH or MTTF for the D D mechanism is normally based on testing. Both EN/IEC 62061 and (EN) ISO 13849-1 advocate a test process known as B10 Testing. D In the B10 test a number of device samples [usually at least ten] are tested under D suitably representative conditions. The mean number of operating cycles achieved before 10% of the samples fail to the dangerous condition is known as the B10d value. In practice it is often the case that all of the samples will fail to a safe state but in that case the standard states that the B10d [dangerous] value can be taken as twice the B10 value. Electronic Technology: There is no physical wear related to moving parts. Given an operating environment commensurate with the specifi ed electrical and temperature characteristics, the predominant failure of an electronic circuit is proportional to the inherent reliability of its constituent components [or lack off it]. There are many reasons for individual component failure; imperfection introduced during manufacture, excessive power surges, mechanical connection problems etc. In general, faults in electronic components can be caused by loading, time and temperature but are diffi cult to predict by analysis and they appear to be random in nature. Therefore testing of an electronic device in test laboratory conditions will not necessarily reveal typical long term failure patterns. In order to determine
