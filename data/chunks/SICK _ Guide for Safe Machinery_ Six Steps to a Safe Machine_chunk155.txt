aligned with programmable electrical systems, in addition to the aspects descri‐ bed above (V model, quality management, etc.), it also includes numerous detailed notes and requirements about the correct approach when developing software for safety-related systems. Result - Determining the SIL for the subsystem First, the safety integrity of the hardware is determined separately for each subsystem: If the subsystems are already developed (as is the case with safety light curtains, for example), the manufacturer of the subsystem will supply the corresponding parameters in the context of the technical specification. A subsys‐ tem of this type is usually described in sufficient detail by the specification of SIL, PFH , and mission time. D For subsystems consisting of subsystem elements (interlocking devices for protective doors or contactors, for example), on the other hand, safety integrity must be determined. SIL claim limit Once the hardware tolerance (architecture) has been specified, the maximum achievable SIL (SIL claim limit) can be determined for the subsystem. Safe failure fraction (SFF) Hardware fault tolerance 0 1 < 60% - SIL 1 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 141 Subject to change without notice 3D – VERIFYING THE SAFETY FUNCTION Safe failure fraction (SFF) Hardware fault tolerance 0 1 60 to < 90% SIL 1 SIL 2 90 to < 99% SIL 2 SIL 3 ≥ 99% SIL 3 SIL 3 A dual-channel system with HFT 1 and an SFF of 90% can achieve SIL3. Example: Determining the SIL and PFH of the “power control elements” subsystem D 1) Definition of the “power control elements” subsystem The “power control elements” subsystem comprises two contactors with “feedback”. As the contactors are positively guided, a safety-rel‐ evant failure of the contactors can be detected (EDM). The UE410 logic unit is not itself part of the
