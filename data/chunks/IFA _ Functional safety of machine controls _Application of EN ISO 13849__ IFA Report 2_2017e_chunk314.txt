S1 and 10D for S2, and thus an MTTF of 173 years. An MTTF of 878 years [D] is stated for the microcontrollers including peri- D D pherals, in accordance with SN 29500-2. At low load, a B of 20,000,000 switching cycles [S] and thus an MTTF 10D D of 1,736 years applies for the contactor relays K3 to K6. The MTTF value of 607 years for the brake/clutch combi- D nation Q1 is calculated from the B value of 7,000,000 cycles [E]. The same value is assumed for the knife locking 10D device Q2 in the second channel. The values for the two directional control valves 2V1 and 2V2 are 150 years [S]. These values result in an MTTF one of each channel of 45.2 years (“high”). D • DC : the DC of 99% for S1/S2 is based upon the cross monitoring of input signals without dynamic test, with fre- avg quent signal changes. The DC of 90% for K1/K2 is derived from self-tests performed by software and the dynamic cross monitoring of data with expectations regarding timing. The DC of 99% for K3 to K6 is derived from plausibility testing by means of mechanically linked contacts. For 2V1/2V2, the DC is 99% owing to indirect and direct electrical monitoring of the pressure with frequent signal changes. Wear in the clutch leads to a change in cutting behaviour. This behaviour is monitored by instruments. A DC of 99% is therefore assumed for Q1. Failure of Q2 is detected immediately owing to cyclical actuation and the monitoring elements B1 and B3. This is the reasoning for a DC of 99%. These values result in a DC of 98.5% (within the tolerance for “high”). avg • Adequate measures against common cause failure (65 points): separation (15), overvoltage protection etc. (15)
