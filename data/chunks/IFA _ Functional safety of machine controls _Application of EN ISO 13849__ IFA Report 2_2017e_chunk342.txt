The situation is different for 10D the formula B = B /RDF is sometimes recommended. the capacitor C1, which has the function of suppressing 10D 10 RDF (ratio of dangerous failure) represents the fraction frequent but not continuous electromagnetic interference of the overall failure rate of an element that can result in (note: this is assumed for the purpose of this example). a dangerous failure.

In the event of an open circuit this reason, B should be limited to twice the value of B on C1, the electromagnetic interference is transported via 10D 10 when B is determined by means of the quotient B /RDF.
