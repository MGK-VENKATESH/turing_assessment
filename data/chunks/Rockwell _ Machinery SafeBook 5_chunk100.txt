These requirements include the provisions for common cause failures, systematic failure, environmental conditions and mission time. If the PFH of the system or subsystem is known, the D tables at Annex K can be used to derive the PL. Subsystem Design and Combinations Subsystems that conform to a PL can be combined into a system using the table as shown.

The system PL can be calculated by other methods including SISTEMA. The rational behind the table is clear. First, that the system can only be as good as its weakest subsystem. Second, the more subsystems there are, the greater the possibility for failure. In the system shown in the following diagram, the lowest Performance Levels are at Subsystems 1 and 2. Both are PLb. Therefore, using this table, we can read across b (in the PLlow column), through 2 (in the Nlow column) and fi nd the achieved system PL as b (in the PL column). If all three subsystems were PLb the achieved PL would be PLa.
