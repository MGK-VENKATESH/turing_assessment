The table also shows the PFH -range that avg d D corresponds to each PL. PL calculation in Step 3 The manufacturer of switches, sensors and logic devices When you calculate the PL for a safety function, it is easiest often have PL and PFH -values for their components, but D to split it into separate, well defined blocks (also called for output devices (such as contactors and valves) you subsystems). It is often logical to make the breakdown do not usually specify a value as it depends on how often according to input, logic and output (e.g. switch - safety the component will be used. You can then either calculate relay - contactors), but there may be more than three blocks yourself according to EN ISO 13849-1 or use the pre- depending on the connection and the number of components calculated example solutions such as those from ABB used (an expansion relay could for example create an Jokab Safety. additional logic block). To calculate PL or PFH for a block, you need to know its D For each block, you calculate a PL or PFH -value. It is category, DC and MTTF . In addition, you need to protect D d easiest if you obtain these values from the component yourself against systematic errors and ensure that an error manufacturer, so you do not have to calculate yourself. does not knock out both channels, and generate and validate any software used correctly. The following text gives a brief explanation of what to do. Safety function (SF) Input Logic Output PL/PFH PL/PFH PL/PFH D D D PFH = PFH + PFH + PFH D,Total D,Input D, Logic D, Output 6 | Safety in control systems according to EN ISO 13849-1 Category failure). To calculate the MTTF , you also need
