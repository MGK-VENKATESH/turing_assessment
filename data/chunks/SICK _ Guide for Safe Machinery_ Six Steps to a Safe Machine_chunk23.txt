in the machine process • The products related to the machine • Intended use but also the unintentional actions of the operator or the reasonably foreseeable misuse of the machine Reasonably foreseeable misuse Reasonably assumable, unintentional actions of the operator or foreseeable misuse may include: • Loss of control of the machine by the operator (particularly on hand-held or portable machinery) • Reflex actions by individuals in the event of a malfunction, a fault, or a failure during the use of the machine • Human error due to lack of concentration or carelessness • Human error due to the selection of the “path of least resistance” in the performance of a task • Actions under pressure to keep the machine in operation whatever happens • Actions by certain groups of people (e.g., children, youths, the disabled) Expected malfunctions and faults There is significant potential for hazards due to malfunctions and faults in the components relevant to functional‐ ity, in particular components of control systems. Examples: • Reversing of a roller movement (with the result that hands are drawn in) • Movement of a robot outside its programmed working area Identification of hazards After defining the function of the machine comes the most important step in the risk assessment on the machine. This step comprises the systematic identification of foreseeable hazards, hazardous situations, and/or hazardous events. Table 1: Example of hazards during the life cycle of a machine In particular the machine manufacturer should take into … in all phases of the service life of the machine. account the hazards listed below… • Mechanical hazards • Transport, assembly, and installation • Electrical hazards • Commissioning • Thermal hazards • Setup • Noise hazards • Normal operation and troubleshooting • Vibration hazards • Maintenance and cleaning • Radiation hazards • Decommissioning, dismantling,
