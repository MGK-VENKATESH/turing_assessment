data- base [49], as denoted by the code [D] under “calculation • DC : in accordance with EN ISO 13849-1, Annex E, of the probability of failure” (see subclause 7.6). Valida- avg the DC values produced for S1/S2 are: 99% (cross tion is described in greater detail in the continuation of monitoring of input signals without dynamic test with this example in subclause 7.6. Since identical elements frequent signal change); for K1/K2: 90% (self-test by may occur more than once (third column), the total failure software and cross monitoring); for K3 to K6: 99% rate for each element type is calculated and indicated in (direct monitoring by mechanically linked contacts); the fourth column. The global approximation that only half for 1V3/2V1: 99% (indirect monitoring by the pressure of the failures are dangerous yields the halved value in sensor); and for 1V4/2V2: 99% (indirect monitoring Column 5. Finally, simple summation produces the total by the function and measurement of a change in the rate of dangerous failures for block K1. Column 6 shows duration of the pressure drop). These values yield a the associated MTTF values in years, derived as the reci- D DC of 98.6% (“high”). procals of the dangerous failure rates (from Column 5, avg following conversion from hours to years). This value is • Adequate measures against common cause failure rounded to 806 years for block K1. Since the database (65 points): separation (15), overvoltage protection employed states identical failure rates for the microcon- etc. (15) and environmental conditions (25 + 10) troller and the ASIC and the circuitry is similar, the MTTF D value of 806 years also applies to block K2. • The combination of control elements satisfies Cate- gory 4 with a high MTTF per channel (31.4 years) and D a DC of 98.6%, within
