These include in particular their behavior in the presence of interferences (sun, lamps, similar types of device, etc.) but also the opening angle of optics in safety light curtains or safety light-beam sensors (the requirements to be met by a type 4 AOPD are more stringent than those for a type 2 AOPD). 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 75 Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION NOTE The aperture angle is decisive in determining the minimum distance in relation to reflective surfaces (see table 28).

Types of protection and required detection capability of the ESPE This section describes the types of protection and which parts of the body should be detected by the ESPE. Hazardous point protection with finger or hand detec‐ tion Hazardous point protection is used to detect when a person comes very close to the hazardous point. This allows the smallest minimum distance to be imple‐ mented. This may be necessary for ergonomic oper‐ ation of the machine, e.g., for insertion work on a press, or to keep the space requirement of the machine low. Fingers/hands must therefore be detected, which requires ESPE with a
