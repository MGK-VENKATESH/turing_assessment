Cookbook (Version 1.0) - 7 - 2 Schematic circuit diagram showing functional and test channels Figure 4: Example 2 with marked functional channel B0 – T1 – G1 and test channel with dedicated disconnect- ing device G2 – K1 – Q1 Chapter 3 explains how the schematic circuit diagram is transformed into a safety-related block diagram. SISTEMA Cookbook (Version 1.0) - 8 - 3 From the schematic circuit diagram to the safety-related block diagram 3 From the schematic circuit diagram to the safety-related block diagram In the next step, the schematic circuit diagram is transformed for each safety function into the logical representation of the safety-related block diagram. In the course of the transformation, the components of the schematic circuit diagram are assigned to "subsystems" with which the safety function is modelled in SISTEMA. In the presentation as a safety-related block diagram the logical interrelationships are rele- vant rather than the physical connections between the components. Each component within a safety function is a constituent part of a certain structure. This structure is termed a "Cate- gory" in EN ISO 13849-1, and grouped within SISTEMA as a subsystem. The sequences of subsystems with their corresponding Categories are represented by a safety function in the form of a safety-related block diagram. The sequence of the subsystems has no bearing upon subsequent calculation of the probability of failure. 3.1 Categories to EN ISO 13849-1 The Categories to EN ISO 13849-1, their characterizing features and their typical representa- tion are shown in Table 1.
