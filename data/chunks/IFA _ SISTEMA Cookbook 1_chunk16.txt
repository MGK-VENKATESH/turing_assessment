percentage is entered on the "DC" tab (2.) for each component to describe the diagnostic coverage of fault detection. Selection of "DC-rating by choosing measures" enables the DC tables in EN ISO 13849-1, Annex E to be accessed via "Library" (3.). The values can be accepted as-is or used for guidance.Where the standard proposes a band of possible DC values, a concrete value within this band can be selected (Figure 22). 22.. 11.. 33.. Figure 22 SISTEMA Cookbook (Version 1.0) - 22 - 4 Transfer to SISTEMA 4.7 Objective attained? Check for error messages (red cross) in the message window (centre, below). If none are present, the PFH can be calculated (Figure 23). Figure 23 The result of the calculation is indicated at the bottom left for the selected safety function and the corresponding subsystems, blocks and elements (Figure 24). The (attained) PL of the safety function must at least equal the (required) PL. If the attained PL is insufficient, r components with a higher MTTF or a higher B value must be employed, the fault detection d 10d (DC) must be improved, or subsystems of other Categories must be implemented.
