areas during operation. This feature can be used, for example, to adapt the monitored area to the speed of a vehicle. Safety laser scanners use individually emitted pulses of light in precise directions and do not continuously cover the area to be monitored. Resolutions (detection capabilities) between 30 mm and 150 mm are achieved through this operating principle. With the active scanning principle, safety laser scanners do not need external receivers or reflectors. Safety laser scanners also have to be able to reliably detect objects with extremely low re- flectivity (e.g., black work clothing). The standards IEC 61496-3, ANSI B11.19, RIA TR R15.406, and CSA Z432 state the safety requirements for AOPDDRs. 7028282/2014-09-08 GUIDE FOR SAFE MACHINERY | SICK 3-29 Subject to change without notice Safeguarding (technical protective measures) Risk reduction Detection capability (resolution) of optoelectronic protective devices The detection capability is defined as the limit for the sensor For safety laser scanners (AOPDDR), the detection capability is parameter that causes the electro-sensitive protective equip- dependent upon the distance to the object, the angle between ยง ment (ESPE) to trigger. the individual beams of light (pulse), and the shape and size of In practice, this is the size of the smallest object detected by the transmitted beam. the ESPE within the defined monitored area (protective field).
