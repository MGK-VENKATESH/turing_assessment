required. Emergency stop control switches must also be located in other places if the risk assessment indicates this (e.g., at entry and exit points or loading and unloading points). Emergency stop control switches that are to be oper‐ ated by hand must be installed at a height between 0.6 and 1.7 m above the access level (reference level). Foot switches for emergency stop functions must be permanently mounted at the access level. Figure 76: Distributed emergency stop control switches on a packaging system Avoiding unintentional triggering Unintentional triggering of emergency stop control switches must be avoided as far as possible without hindering intentional triggering. This is more likely to be achieved by layout than by design measures: • Locating the emergency stop device away from foreseeably busy areas • Mounting the emergency stop device in a recessed surface of the enclosing operator panel • Selecting a suitable type of emergency stop device • Selecting the appropriate size and shape of the emergency stop device The use of a protective collar around the emergency stop device should be avoided. An exception exists if unintentional actuation must be prevented and other measures are not practicable. Protective collars must not have any sharp corners or edges or rough surfaces and must not hinder or prevent operation with the palm of the hand. This applies from any foreseeable position of the machine operator or other persons who must be able to operate it (nearby operator or work stations). Emergency stop control switches in portable operator panels When emergency stop control switches are installed in portable operator panels, measures must be used to avoid confusion between active and non-active emergency stop control switches. This also applies to operator panels where the emergency stop commands are transmitted via plug connections on the controller. At least one
