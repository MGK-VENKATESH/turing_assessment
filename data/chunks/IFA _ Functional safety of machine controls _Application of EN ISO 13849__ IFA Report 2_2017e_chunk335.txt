Other failures increase the Part 1, Annex C. In particular, a method is shown here by probability of this happening in that a smaller number of which failure rates for discrete, cyclically operating elec- further failures is now sufficient to cause the system to fail tromechanical, fluid power and mechanical components dangerously. Should no redundancy exist for the function can be derived from the “B ” values (see Table D.2 of 10D block suffering failure, i.e. no second channel capable of this report). assuming its function, and should diagnostics fail to per- form sufficiently rapidly an action producing a safe state, Should a conservative estimate of the failure rate not be the dangerous failure of the function block leads to dan- chosen, it must be ensured for each component that the gerous failure of the system.

The inherent heating effect must modes of the function block under analysis causes a also be taken into account. Standard data sources, such dangerous system failure, its “dangerous” failure mode as [3 to 6], provide measures by which the base failure can and must be identified. The dangerous failure mode rates applicable under defined reference conditions can is that leading to the function block no longer making its be converted
