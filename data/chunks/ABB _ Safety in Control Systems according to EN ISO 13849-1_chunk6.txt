risk evaluation of the degree of risk. According to EN ISO 13849-1 the risk is where you determine if the risk needs to be reduced or if estimated using three factors: injury severity (S, severity), frequency sufficient safety is ensured. 4 | Safety in control systems according to EN ISO 13849-1 tnemssessa ksiR sisylana ksiR Working method as specified in EN ISO 13849-1 Step 1 Determine the system's scope (space, usage, time, environment) Identify risk sources (all work operations during the life cycle) Estimate the risk (determine PL with S, F and P) r Evaluate the risk (is action required?) Step 2 Reduce the risk (pre-empt, use protection, information) PL r Risk estimation low risk To calculate the performance level required (PLr).

Avoid the risk already at the design stage. (For example, reduce power, avoid interference in the danger zone.) 2. Use protection and/or safety devices. (For example, fences, light grids or control devices.) 3. Provide information about how the machine can be used Step 3 safely. (For example, in manuals and on signs.) If risk reduction
