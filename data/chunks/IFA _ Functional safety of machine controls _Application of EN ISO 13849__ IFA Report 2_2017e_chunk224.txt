not be used for the electrical drive of 1V1. • In order to prevent a systematic failure, the higher-level de-energization function (acting upon exhaust valve 0V1 in this example) is checked at suitable intervals, e.g. daily. • For use in applications with infrequent operator intervention in the hazard zone. This enables the requirement of the designated architecture for Category 2 to be satisfied. The requirement is for testing to be performed immedia- tely when a demand is made upon the safety function, and for the total time for detection of the failure and placing of the machine in a non-hazardous state, for example in consideration of the overrun, which depends upon factors including the depressurization and switching times of the valves (depressurization in this case is at a higher level via the valve 0V1), to be shorter than the time to attainment of the hazard (see also EN ISO 13855 and cf. sub- clause 6.2.14). • The standard component K1 is employed in accordance with the information in subclause 6.3.10. • The software (SRASW) is programmed in accordance with the requirements for PL b (downgraded owing to diver- sity) and the information in subclause 6.3. 133 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS Calculation of the probability of failure • MTTF of the functional channel: a B value of 20,000,000 switching cycles [S] is assumed for the directional con- D 10D trol valve 1V1. At 240 working days, 16 working hours per day and a cycle time of 5 seconds, n is 2,764,800 swit- op ching cycles per year and the MTTF is 72.3 years. This is also the MTTF value for the functional channel. D D • MTTF of the test channel: an MTTF value of 150 years [E] is assumed for the displacement measurement system D D 1S1. An MTTF
