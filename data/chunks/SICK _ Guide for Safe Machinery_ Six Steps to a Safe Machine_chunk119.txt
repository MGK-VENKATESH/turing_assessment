(type-B standard) Application of reset and restart If a protective device triggers a stop command, the stop status must be maintained until a safe state for a restart exists. The risk assessment may indicate that the stop status must only be ended by means of a manual, separate and intentional reset. The machine can be restarted in a further step. The reset must be performed using a special operated device. The operated device must be able to withstand the foreseeable stresses and must be used properly to prevent unintentional actuation (touch panels may be unsuita‐ ble). Furthermore, the device must be installed in a safe location outside the hazardous area. The hazardous area must be fully visible from this location to ensure that no person is in the hazardous area. The signal from the operated device must enable the controller to issue a separate start command for restarting. The signal processing must ensure that the restart can only take place if all safety functions and protective devices are functional. 110 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION ISO 13849-1 (section 5.2.2) therefore requires that resetting may only occur by releasing the command device from its actuated (ON) position and that the signal processing should detect the falling signal edge of the command device. This means that the acknowl‐ edgment must only occur by releasing the actuating element from its actuated (ON) position. Figure 92: The position of the reset pushbutton allows a full view of the hazardous area when resetting the protective device. Manual resetting is a safety function and must be implemented accordingly, e.g., by applying the ISO 13849-1 or IEC 62061 standards. The signal (on actuation) of the reset device is part of the
