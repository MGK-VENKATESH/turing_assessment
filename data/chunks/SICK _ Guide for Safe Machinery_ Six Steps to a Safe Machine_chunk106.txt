The following figure shows a horizontally arranged AOPD and the calculation of the minimum distance S. If the installation height of the AOPD is increased to 300 mm, the minimum distance is reduced. For this height, an AOPD with a resolution less than or equal to 80 mm can be used. It must not be possible, however, to access the hazardous area beneath the AOPD (evaluate the risk of crawling beneath). This type of safeguarding is also often implemented using AOPDDR (laser scanners). However, supplements have to be added for these devices for technology-related reasons.
