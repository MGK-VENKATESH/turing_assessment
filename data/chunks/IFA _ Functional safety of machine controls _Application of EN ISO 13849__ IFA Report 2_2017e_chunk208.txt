and the MTTF is 5,707 years. For op D the contactor Q1, the B value corresponds under inductive load (AC 3) to an electrical durability of 1,300,000 swit- 10 ching cycles [M]. If 50% of failures are assumed to be dangerous, the B value is produced by doubling of the B 10D 10 value. The above assumed value for n results in an MTTF of 742 years for Q1. The combination of B1 and Q1 results op D in an MTTF of 656 years for each channel. This value is capped to 100 years (“high”). D • DC and measures against common cause failures are not relevant in Category 1. avg • The electromechanical control system satisfies Category 1 with a high MTTF (100 years). This results in an average D probability of dangerous failure of 1.1 · 10-6 per hour. This satisfies PL c. The PL of b is therefore surpassed. r More detailed reference • IEC 60947-5-1: Low-voltage switchgear and controlgear – Part 5-1: Control circuit devices and switching elements – Electromechanical control circuit devices (2009) + A1 (2012) Figure 8.12: Determining of the PL by means of SISTEMA 117 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS 8.2.6 Start/stop facility with emergency stop device – Category 1 – PL c (Example 6) L S1 Emergency stop S2 Q1 Q1 START S3 STOP M 3~ Q1 Figure 8.13: Combined start/stop facility with emergency stop device Safety function • Emergency stop function, STO – safe torque off by actuation of the emergency stop device Functional description • Hazardous movements or states are de-energized by interruption of the control voltage of contactor Q1 when the emergency stop device S1 is actuated. • The safety function cannot be maintained with all component failures, and is dependent upon the reliability of the components. • No
