value applies to ABB industrial robots with IRC5 in a cell, the safety functions can be defined in different ways controller). depending on the risk analysis. The safety functions are Only safety functions to help cut the power to the industrial represented by block diagrams.

Note that the above functions are only selected examples of the safety functions that appear in the robot cell. Safety in control systems according to EN ISO 13849-1 | 13 What defines a safety function? Calculating that you have achieved the PL that is required is not difficult, especially if you use “pre-calculated” r safety devices and logic units. But what parts should then be included in each safety function? This must be resolved before you
