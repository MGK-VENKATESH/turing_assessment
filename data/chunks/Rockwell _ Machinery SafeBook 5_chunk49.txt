be operated continuously during the hazardous conditions. Machine operation must cease when either of the controls are released, if one control is released, the other control must also be released before the machine can be restarted. This provides “anti-tie down” and prevents the two hand action from being manipulated into a one hand action. A two-hand control system depends heavily on the integrity of its control and monitoring system to detect any faults, so it is important that this aspect is designed to the correct specifi cation. Performance of the two-hand safety system is characterized into Types by ISO 13851 (EN 574) as shown and they are related to the Categories from ISO 13849-1. The types most commonly used for machinery safety are IIIB and IIIC. The table below shows the relationship of the types to the categories of safety performance. Types Requirements III I II A B C Synchronous actuation X X X Use of Category 1 (from ISO 13849-1) X X Use of Category 3 (from ISO 13849-1) X X Use of Category 4 (from ISO 13849-1) X Table of requirements from ISO 13851 The physical design spacing should prevent improper operation (e.g., by hand and elbow). This can be accomplished by distance or shields. The machine should not go from one cycle to another without the releasing and pressing of both buttons. This provides “anti-repeat” and prevents the possibility of both buttons being blocked, leaving the machine running continuously. Releasing of either button must cause the machine to stop. 41 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery The use of two-hand control should be considered with caution as it usually leaves some form of risk exposed. The two-hand control only protects the person using them. The protected operator must be able to observe all access
