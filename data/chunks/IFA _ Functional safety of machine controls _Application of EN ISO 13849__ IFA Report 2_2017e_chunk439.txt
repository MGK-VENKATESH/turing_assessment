Following publication of the third edition of the standard, this information sheet was withdrawn, as its regulatory content was adopted in the standard. It has been included here for the purpose of illustrating the handling of overlapping hazards. 331111 312 Annex J Safety functions to EN ISO 13849-­‐1 where multiple overlapping hazards are present On complex manufacturing systems and machine tools, overlapping hazards may arise in working C ontents areas as a result of hazardous movements caused for example by multiple feed axis drives 1 Current situation with closed-­‐loop control. This information sheet describes a procedure, agreed with OSH experts 2 Handling of overlapping hazards in and the Institute for Occupational Safety and Health of the German Social Accident Insurance practice (IFA), by which safety functions with overlapping hazards can be modelled and analysed by application of EN ISO 13849-­‐1 [1] or IEC 62061 [2]. 1 Current situation The analysis of discrete hazards is proven good Prism magazine Q5 practice in safety technology. Probabilistic analysis (behind end panel) in accordance with EN ISO 13849-­‐1 or IEC 61508 [3, 4] and IEC 62061 and the risk assessment for a hazard situation show however that consideration must also be given to the overlap of hazards. The paper [5] provides a basis for discussion of the consequences of a probabilistic approach to the
