comes to application code, the software that a user interfaces with, most programmable safety devices are provided with “certifi ed” function blocks or routines. This simplifi es the validation task for application code but it must be remembered that the completed application program still needs to be validated. The way the blocks are linked and parameterised must be proved correct and valid for the intended task. (EN) ISO 13849-1 and IEC/EN 62061 both provide guidelines for this process.

Those Categories require some form of diagnostic testing to check whether the safety function is still working. The term “diagnostic coverage” [usually abbreviated to DC] is used to characterise the effectiveness of this testing. It is important to realise that DC is not based just on the number of components that can fail dangerously. It takes account of the total dangerous failure rate. The symbol λ is used for “failure rate”. DC expresses the relationship of the rates of occurrence of the two following types of dangerous failure; Dangerous detected failure [λdd] i.e. Those failures that would cause, or could lead to, a loss of the safety function, but which are detected. After detection, a fault reaction function causes the device or system to go to safe state. Dangerous failure [λd] i.e. All those failures that could potentially cause, or lead to, a loss of the safety function. This includes both the failures that are detected and those that are not. Of course the failures
