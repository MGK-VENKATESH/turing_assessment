changes made to the conformity assessment procedures for Annex IV equipment. Detailed information and guidance on the defi nition and all other aspects of the Machinery Directive can be found at the offi cial EU website: http://ec.europa.eu/growth/sectors/mechanical-engineering/machinery/index_en.htm The key provisions of the original Directive (98/37/EC) came into force for machinery on January 1, 1995 and for Safety Components on January 1, 1997. The provisions of the current Directive (2006/42/EC) became applicable on December 29, 2009. It is the responsibility of the manufacturer or his authorized representative to ensure that equipment supplied is in conformity with the Directive.

The purpose of this list is to ensure that the machinery is safe and is designed and constructed so that it can be used, adjusted and maintained throughout all phases of its life without putting persons at risk. The following text provides a quick overview of some Machine must meet EHSRs typical requirements but it is important to consider all of the EHSRs given in Annex 1. A risk assessment must be carried out to determine which EHSRs are applicable to the equipment under consideration. The EHSRs in Annex 1 provides a hierarchy of measures for eliminating the risk: (1)Inherently Safe Design. Where possible the design itself will
