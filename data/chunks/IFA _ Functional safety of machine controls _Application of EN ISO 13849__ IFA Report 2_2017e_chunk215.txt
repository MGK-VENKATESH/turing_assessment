The behaviour can be modified by corres- ponding adaptation of the circuit. Calculation of the probability of failure • By way of example, three light barriers F1 to F3 are considered for calculation of the probability of failure. Safeguar- ding of a second hazard zone constitutes a further safety function for which calculation is performed separately. • For calculation of the probability of failure, the overall system is divided into two subsystems, “light barriers” and “main contactor relay” (Q1). For the “light barriers” subsystem: • F1, F2, F3 and K2 constitute the functional path of the Category 2 circuit structure; the PLC K3 (including decoupling diode R2) constitutes the test equipment. S2 and K1 have the function of activating testing of the light barrier, and are not involved in the calculation of the probability of failure. • MTTF : an MTTF of 100 years [E] is assumed for each of F1 to F3. The B value for K2 is 20,000,000 cycles [S]. D D 10D At 240 working days, 16 working hours and a cycle time of 180 seconds, n is 76,800 cycles per year. Testing as op described above doubles this value, to an n of 153,600 cycles per year with an MTTF of 1,302 years for K2. op D 125 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS These values yield an MTTF of 32 years (“high”) for the functional channel. An MTTF of 50 years [E] is assumed for D D K3. Compared to this value, the MTTF value of 228,311 years [S] for the decoupling diode R2 is irrelevant. D • DC : the reasoning for the DC of 60% for F1 to F3 is the functional test as described. The DC of 99% for K2 is avg derived from direct monitoring in K3 with the aid of mechanically
