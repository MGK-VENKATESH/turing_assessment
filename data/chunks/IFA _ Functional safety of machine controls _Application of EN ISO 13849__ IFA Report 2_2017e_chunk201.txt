2) hazardous 1A movement well-tried valve for 1V1 safety-related applications further loads and control systems 0S1 P 0V1 0Z Figure 8.5: Pneumatic valve for the control of hazardous movements Safety functions • Safety-related stop function: stopping of the hazardous movement and prevention of unexpected start-up from the rest position, implemented by safety sub-function SSC. • Only the pneumatic part of the control system is shown here, in the form of a subsystem. Further safety-related parts of control systems (e.g. safeguards and electrical logic elements) must be added in the form of subsystems for completion of the safety function. Functional description • Hazardous movements are controlled by a directional control valve 1V1 that is well-tried for safety applications. • Failure of the directional control valve may result in loss of the safety function. The failure is dependent upon the reliability of the directional control valve. • No measures for fault detection are implemented. • Should trapped compressed air pose a further hazard, additional measures are required. Design features • Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. 108 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS 1V1 • 1V1 is a directional control valve with closed centre position, sufficient overlap, spring-centred central position and fatigue-resistant springs. • The safety-oriented switching position is attained by cancellation of the control signal. • The manufacturer/user must confirm that the directional control valve is a component that is well-tried for safety applications (of sufficiently high reliability). • The safety function can also be attained by a logical arrangement of suitable valves. Calculation of the probability of failure • MTTF : a B value of 20,000,000 switching cycles [S] is assumed for the directional control valve 1V1.
