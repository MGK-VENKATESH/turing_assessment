Tabular determination of performance level based on the Subsystems performance levels of each subsystem A safety function that is implemented using control measures • Detailed method (g 3-82): generally comprises sensor, logic unit, and actuator. Such a Mathematical determination of performance level based chain can include, on the one hand, discrete elements such on the PFHd values of the subsystems (this method is only as guard interlocking devices or valves and complex safety described indirectly in the standard) controllers. As a rule, it is therefore necessary to divide a safety More realistic performance levels than those using the sim- function into subsystems. plified method can be
