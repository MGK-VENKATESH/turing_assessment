The performance level depends on the structure of the control system, the reliability of the components used, the ability to detect faults as well as the resistance to common cause faults in multi-channel controllers (see section "Safety-related aspects of subsystems", page 56). In addition, further measures to avoid design faults are required. If the probability of occurrence of a hazardous event can be assessed as low, the PLr may be reduced by one level. This method is described in Annex A of the standard. This annex is informative and not normative. It is not necessary, therefore, to apply the process described there in order to fully comply with the requirements of the standard. The SCRAM method from SICK can also be used as an alternative. The advantage is the universal applicability and the finer granularity of the decision parameters see "Scalable Risk Analysis and Evaluation Method (SCRAM)", page 24. Required safety integrity level (SIL) according to IEC 62061 The procedure used here is a numerical procedure. The severity, the frequency and duration of exposurein the hazardous area, and the probability of avoiding or limiting harm are evaluated. In addition, the probability of occurrence of the hazardous event is taken into consideration. The result is the required safety integrity level (SIL).
