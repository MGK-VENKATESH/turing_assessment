(July 2023) 9 / 12 13 Annex D: Diagnostic coverage In Table E.1 with examples of fault detection measures, there are now additional notes for the estimated DC, where previously a range of achievable DC values was provided: • An FMEA (failure mode and effects analysis) must generally be used as the basis for determining the DC in the actual application. • When monitoring outputs and cross-monitoring input or output signals without dynamic testing, the test rate resulting from the relevant application can act as a limiting factor for the DC, e.g. by allowing only tests that occur at least once a month to achieve a DC of 99%, and by estimating tests at a DC of 0% if they occur less frequently than once a year. • For fault detection by the process, the ratio between the process diagnostic rate (test rate) and the demand rate of the safety function can be used to limit the achievable effective DC value down to a value of 60%. • Several DC measures acting on a component can be combined to achieve a higher DC. Furthermore, this combination of DC measures can overcome the limitation that fault detection by the process is insufficient as the only measure for PL e. r 14 Annexes F and I: CCFs and examples showing the simplified procedure to estimate PL Measures against common cause failures (CCFs) are now only listed in Table F.1, but are described in more detail than previously in the new subsection F.3. A new note has been added, emphasising that where SRP/CS are not sufficiently protected against over-voltage or other environmental influences at the component level, the required protection can also be achieved at the system level, e.g. through external protection components, filters or shielding. Anti-CCF measures are usually assessed at the
