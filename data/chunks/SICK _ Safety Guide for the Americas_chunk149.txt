However, fault exclusion in the event of the springs breaking is not possible. 3 An important differentiating factor between the valves is the c design of the moving switching element inside the valve. The failure mode for each valve is essentially determined by its design. Poppet valves might leak, but in piston valves, the piston slide might jam. With a poppet valve, the switching function is affected by the moving switching element (valve plate), which changes position relative a seat inside the housing. This design enables large cross-sections to be released with short strokes. The risk of leaks can be excluded with an appropriate design.
