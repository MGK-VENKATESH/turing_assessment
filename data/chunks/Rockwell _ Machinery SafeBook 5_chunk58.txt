from the normal controls. (EN) ISO 13849-1 cites the change of state from energized to de-energized (‘falling edge’). The reset switch should be located in a place that provides a good view of the hazard so that the operator can check that the area is clear before operation. Auto/ Manual Reset Some safety relays have automatic/manual reset. The manual reset mode is not monitored and reset occurs when the button is pressed. A short circuited or jammed in reset switch will not be detected. With this approach it may not be possible to achieve the requirements for additional manual reset as given in (EN) ISO 13849-1 unless additional means are used. Alternatively the reset line can be jumpered allowing an automatic reset. The user must then provide another mechanism for preventing machine start-up when the gate closes. An auto-reset device does not require a manual switching action but after de- actuation it will always conduct a system integrity check before resetting the system. An auto-reset system should not be confused with a device without reset facilities. In the latter the safety system will be enabled immediately after de-actuation but there will be no system integrity check. The reset switch should be located in a place that provides a good view of the hazard so that the operator can check that the area is clear before operation. Control Guards A control guard stops a machine when the guard is opened and directly starts it again when the guard is closed. The use of control guards is only allowed under certain stringent conditions because any unexpected start-up or failure to stop would be extremely dangerous. The interlocking system must have the highest possible reliability (it is often advisable to use guard locking). The use of control guards can only be considered on
