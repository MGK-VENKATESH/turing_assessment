so that the risk is eliminated as far as possible. 2 Define, apply, and check the required protective measures. 3 Define how any remaining residual risks can be reduced and provide this information to the user. Technical protective measure • Either of the ISO 13849-1 (PL) or IEC 62061 (SIL) standards can provide assistance with regard to functional safety. • Define the safety functions and determine the required safety level for each. • Draft the safety concept. Select the most effective protective devices and how they will be assembled and integrated into the control system. • Make sure that the protective measures are implemented effectively and that the required safety level is achieved. 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 153 Subject to change without notice 5 – OVERALL VALIDATION 5 – Overall validation As functional safety is only one component of risk reduction, all measures (design and build, technological, and organizational) shall be assessed for their overall effect as part of an overall validation process. Figure 125: Service employee from SICK performing an overall validation of a machine In practice, therefore, it may be the case that an individual technical measure does not reduce risk however a satisfactory result is achieved in the overall context. Sufficient risk reduction can be considered to have been achieved if all of the following questions can be answered with “yes”: • Have all operating conditions in all phases of the machine's life cycle been taken into account? • Was the 3-step method used? • Have the hazards been dealt with or the risks posed by the hazards minimized to the fullest possible practical extent? • Is there an assurance that the measures taken will not result in new hazards? • Have users been given sufficient information about and warning of
