Safe exhaust and reversing – the dual valve for twice the safety. Standard-compliant safety with minimal response times Series SV dual valves are redundant 3/2 or 5/2 directional valves with direct monitoring that meet requirements to protect against unexpected start-up, as well as safe exhaust (3/2 directional valve) and save reversing (5/2 directional valve) in pneumatic safety controls. The 3/2 dual valves only activate the compressed air supply when all conditions for a safe system start-up have been met, preventing potential accidents. In the event of a machine fault or emergency OFF, the valve exhausts the operating lines, ensuring a de-energized and thus safe state.
