In other words, each output status of an actuating subsystem that signals the demand of the safety function must be a suitable initiating event for initiating the safe state of the downstream subsystem.

In order to prevent an unnecessarily high wiring overhead, the minor underestimation of the PFH during addition is tolerable.
