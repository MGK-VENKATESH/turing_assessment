via the MTTF and DC , the PL for the combination the valid range (on a logarithmic scale) is assumed by D avg is geared to the lowest PL in the series arrangement, and approximation for the PL in question. low not to the lowest individual Category. A rising number of control elements and their respective contributions to the Table 6.7: PFH also increases the overall probability of failure PFH Simplified calculation of the PL for series arrangements of D D of the system as a whole. Consequently, the PL of the subsystems series arrangement can be reduced by a further level from PL N Overall PL the lowest subsystem PL if for example addition of the low low PFH values causes the threshold of the PFH to the next a ≥ 4 No PL, not permitted D D PL down to be crossed. ≤ 3 a b ≥ 3 Values for the average probability of a dangerous failure ≤ 2 b per hour PFH are normally available for all subsystems D c ≥ 3 (values for SIL and PFH to IEC 61508 [10] or IEC 62061 D ≤ 2 c [11] are also suitable). The PFH relevant to the overall PL D value can then be formed by summation of these values: d ≥ 4 ≤ 3 d N PFH =∑PFH = PFH + PFH + ... + PFH (5) e ≥ 4 D Di D1 D2 N i=1 ≤ 3 e where 73 6 Design of safe control systems Since with both methods, all subsystem PLs are always either for the quantifiable aspects (e.g. Category 1 twice at least as great as the overall PL, it is also ensured that in parallel still does not equate to Category 3, since it all measures for non-quantifiable, qualitative aspects lacks
