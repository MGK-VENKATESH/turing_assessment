Validation at a later stage examines whether the PL attained by the actual control system (actual value) is greater than or equal to the PL. In this context, “greater than” means: PL = e > PL = d > PL = c > PL = b > PL = a 32 5 Safety functions and their contribution to risk reduction From the starting-point, the following risk parameters are considered for the duration of the hazard
