as an uncontrolled stop because, in some circumstances, motion can take some time to cease because the motor may be free to coast to a stop. Stop Category 1 requires that power is retained to apply braking until the stop is achieved and then remove power to the actuator. Note: See IEC 60204-1 for information on Stop Categories 1a and 1b. Stop Category 2 is a controlled stop with power left available to the machine actuators. A normal production stop is considered a category 2 stop. Note that only Stop Categories 0 or 1 can be used as emergency stops. The choice of which of the two Categories to use should be dictated by a risk assessment. All the circuit examples shown so far in this chapter have used a Stop Category 0. A Stop Category 1 is achieved with a time-delayed output for the fi nal removal of power. An interlocked guard with guardlocking often accompanies a Category 1 stop system. This keeps the guard locked in a closed position until the machine has reached a safe (i.e., stopped) state. Stopping a machine without taking proper account of the programmable controller may affect restarting and could result in tool and machine damage. A standard (non safety) PLC alone cannot be relied on for a safety related stopping task; therefore, other approaches need to be considered. Two possible solutions for category 1 stopping are given below: 1. Safety Relay with Time Delayed Override Command A safety relay with both immediate acting and delayed action outputs is used. The immediate acting outputs are connected to inputs at the programmable device (e.g., PLC or the drive “enable”) and the delayed acting outputs are connected to a main contactor. When the guard interlock switch is actuated, the immediate outputs on the safety relay
