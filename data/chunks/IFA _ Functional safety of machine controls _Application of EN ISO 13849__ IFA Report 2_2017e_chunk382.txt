What is stated in the standard? – Electro mechanical Regarding modelling, the standard states that the compo- components in accordance with Part 2 of the standard nents “can be estimated as a Category 1 or Category 3/4 subsystem depending on the number of electrical output Table D.8 of EN ISO 13849-2 applies to switches, such contacts and on the fault detection in the subsequent as electromechanical position switches and manually SRP/CS. Each contact element (including the mechanical operated switches, and can therefore be applied to all actuation) can be considered as one channel with a res- the electromechanical components referred to above.
