start calculating phase. To summarise in simple terms you can say that each safety device gives rise to a safety function for each machine that is affected by the safety device in question. Three safety devices that all cut the power to three machines in a cell is therefore equal to nine safety functions. In the section that follows, we explain the background. Multiple safety functions for a machine Three safety functions (SF) are defined for the machine and Multiple safety devices are often used on a machine in are calculated as: order to provide satisfactory and practical protection for SF1: PFH , + PFH , + PFH , = PFH , D F1 D K1 D Q1 D SF1 the operators. In the following example, the machine is SF2: PFH , + PFH , + PFH , = PFH , D B1 D K1 D Q1 D SF2 protected by three safety devices connected to a logic SF3: PFH , + PFH , + PFH , = PFH , D S1 D K1 D Q1 D SF3 device. The following figure illustrates this interconnection schematically.

The power to be protected by multiple safety devices. The following figure all three machines must be cut when the operator enters the illustrates the interconnection schematically for an example. cell through the door interlocked by B1. Each of the machines Q1 â€“ Q3 is shut down separately and independently of K1. F1 Q1 Light curtain
