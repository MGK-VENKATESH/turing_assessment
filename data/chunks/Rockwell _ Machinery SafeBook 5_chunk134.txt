the safety relay circuit to confi rm that it is wired as documented in the schematics. 3 Confi rm that the confi guration in the 440C-CR30 confi gurable safety relay is the correct, intended confi guration. Normal Operation Verifi cation - The safety system properly responds to all normal Start, Stop, Reset, Emergency Stop and SensaGuard switch inputs. Test Step Verifi cation Pass/Fail Changes/ Modifi cations 1 Confi rm that no one is in the guarded area. 2 Confi rm that the hazardous motion is stopped. 3 Confi rm that the door is closed. 4 Apply power to the safety system. 5 Confi rm that the Terminal 00, Terminal 01, and SMF1 input status indicator LEDs of the 440C-CR30 safety relay are green. Confi rm that all output status indicators are OFF. Confi rm that the Power and Run status indicator LEDs are green. Monitor the 440C-CR30 safety relay for proper status by using Connected Components Workbench software. 6 Press and release the Reset button on the 440C-CR30 safety relay. Confi rm that the Terminal 18, Terminal 19, and SOF1 output status indicator LEDs are green. Monitor the status indicator LEDs for proper operation, and monitor the 440C-CR30 safety relay for proper status by using Connected Components Workbench software. 130 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Application Examples 7 Confi rm that the hazardous motion does not start on powerup. 8 Press and release the drive Start button.
