types of devices do not provide protection against projectiles, mists, fl uids, or other types of hazards. The best choice of protective measure is a device or system that provides the maximum protection with the minimum hindrance to normal machine operation. All aspects of machine use must be considered, as experience shows that a system that is diffi cult to use is more likely to be removed or by-passed. Presence Sensing Devices IEC 62046 gives useful guidance on the application of presence sensing devices. Its use is recommended. When deciding how to protect a zone or area it is important to have a clear understanding of exactly what safety functions are required. In general there will be at least two functions. • Switch off or disable power when a person enters the hazard area. • Prevent switching on or enabling of power when a person is in the hazard area. At fi rst thought these may seem to be one and the same thing but although they are obviously linked, and are often achieved by the same equipment, they are actually two separate safety functions. To achieve the fi rst point we need to use some form of trip device. In other words a device which detects that a part of a person has gone beyond a certain point and gives a signal to trip off the power. If the person is then able to continue past this tripping point and their presence is no longer detected then the second point (preventing switching on) may not be achieved. 35 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery p Point: Start of End of Trip Point: Start of Detection Detection Detection Detected Detected Undetected Hazard Hazard Full body access Partial body access The picture shows a full body access example
