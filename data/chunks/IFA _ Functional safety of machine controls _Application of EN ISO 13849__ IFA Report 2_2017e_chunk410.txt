of course permissible to calculate the probability of failure using an MTTF of the functional D channel that is reduced mathematically to double the MTTF of the implemented test channel. D 292 Annex F: Common cause failure (CCF) Changes with respect to the second edition purpose by which β values of between 0.5 and 10% can (BGIA Report 2/2008e): be determined. Points are assigned in a long list of meas- ures sorted according to different causes; when certain Text of the descriptions of the measures brought into rules are applied, the sum of these points results in an line with the third edition of the standard estimated β value. EN ISO 13849-1 takes up this method, both in simplified form and with adaptation to machine safety. Simplification is based upon technical measures The term common cause failure (CCF) describes the fact that experts have considered particularly useful for the that in a redundant system or a single-channel system avoidance of CCF.
