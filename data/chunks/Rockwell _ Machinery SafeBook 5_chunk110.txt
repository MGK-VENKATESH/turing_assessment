awarded for employing specifi c measures against CCF. The score is added up to determine the common cause failure factor, which is shown in the following table. The beta factor is used in the subsystem models to “adjust” the failure rate. Overall Score Common Cause failure factor (R) <35 10% (0,1) 35 - 65 5% (0,05) 65 - 85 2% (0,02) 85 - 100 1% (0,01) Beta Factor for Common Cause Failure Diagnostic Coverage (DC) Automatic diagnostic tests are employed to decrease the probability of dangerous hardware failures. Being able to detect all dangerous hardware failures would be ideal, but in practice the maximum value is set at 99% (this can also be expressed as 0.99) Diagnostic coverage is the ratio of the probability of detected dangerous failures to the probability all the dangerous failures. Probability of Detected dangerous failures, λDD DC = --------------------------------------------------------------- Probability of Total dangerous failures, λDtotal The value of diagnostic coverage will lie between zero and 99%. 95 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery Hardware Fault Tolerance Hardware fault tolerance represents the number of faults that can be sustained by a subsystem before it causes a dangerous failure. For example, a hardware fault tolerance of 1 means that 2 faults could cause a loss of the safety related control function but one fault would not. Management of Functional Safety The standard gives requirements for the control of management and technical activities that are necessary for the achievement of a safety related electrical control system. Proof Test Interval The proof test interval represents the time after which a subsystem must be either totally checked or replaced to ensure that it is in an “as new” condition. In practice, in the machinery sector, this is achieved by replacement. So the proof test interval is usually
