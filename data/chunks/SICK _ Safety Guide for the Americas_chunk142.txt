Safeguarding (technical protective measures) Risk reduction Power control elements The safety function initiated by the protective devices and the logic unit shall stop hazardous machine functions. For this purpose, § the actuator elements or work elements are switched off by power control elements. - Principle of switch off/power shutdown: ISO 13849-2 (B-type standard) Contactors N/C Electromechanical contactors are the most commonly used type of power control element. One or more contactors can ≥0.5 mm 1 form a safety function subsystem by combining special selec- N/O tion criteria, wiring, and technical measures. By protecting the contacts against overcurrent and short-circuits, over-sizing (normally by a factor of 2), and other measures, a contac- tor is considered a proven component. To be able to perform diagnostics on contactors for safety functions, unambiguous 2 feedback of the output state is necessary, known as “external device monitoring” (EDM). This requirement can be met using a contactor with positively guided contacts. The contacts are ≥0.5 mm N/C positively guided when all contacts within a set are mechani- cally linked in such a way that normally open contacts and 3 normally closed contacts can never be closed simultaneously at any point during the intended mission time. c The term “positively guided contacts” refers primarily to N/O auxiliary contactors and auxiliary contacts. A defined distance between the contacts of at least 0.5 mm at the normally closed contact must be ensured even in the event of a fault (welded N/O contact). As with contactors with low switching capacity (< 4 kW), there is
