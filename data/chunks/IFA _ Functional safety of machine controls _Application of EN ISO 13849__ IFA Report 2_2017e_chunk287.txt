electrical logic elements) must be added in the form of subsystems for completion of the safety function. Functional description • Hazardous movements are executed by two actuators, 1A and 2A, in the same hazard zone. The two movements can be stopped either by the two directional control valves 1V5 and 2V1, or at a higher level by the directional con- trol valve 1V3. • Failure of one of these valves alone does not result in loss of the safety function. • 1V5 and 2V1 are actuated cyclically in the process. 1V3 closes only in response to a demand of the safety function, but at least once per shift. 198 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS 1V5 2V1 1V3 1S3 • A technical measure for fault detection is implemented only on 1V3 (position monitoring by 1S3). Certain faults on the unmonitored valves become apparent in the work process. An accumulation of undetected faults may lead to loss of the safety function. Design features • Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. • The directional control valves 1V5 and 2V1 feature a closed centre position with sufficient overlap and spring- centred central position. 1V3 employs electrical position monitoring, since 1V3 is not switched cyclically. • The safety-oriented switch position is attained in each case by removal of the control signal (electrical or hydrau- lic). • A single-channel PLC for example is employed for processing signals from the electrical position monitor. Calculation of the probability of failure • MTTF : an MTTF of 150 years is assumed for the directional control valves 1V3, 1V5 and 2V1 [M]. Capping of the D D second channel (1V3) to 100 years produces a symmetrized MTTF value of 88 years (“high”). D • DC : a DC of 99% for
