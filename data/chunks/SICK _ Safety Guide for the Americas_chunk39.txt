func- process must take into account all hazards and risks until tions of the machine . there are no residual risks or only acceptable residual • During the risk assessment take into account in particular risks remain . foreseeable misuse and faults . • Identify the tasks performed by affected personnel (opera- tors, maintenance personnel, etc .) . Take into account the 1 level of training, experience and other human factors, such as incentives to defeat protective measures . • Identify the hazards (mechanical, electrical, thermal, etc.) posed by the machine. Take into account these hazards in all phases of the service life of the machine . • Estimate the risks posed by the hazards. These depend on the extent of injury and the probability of occurrence of the harm . • Document the results of the risk assessment . 7028282/2014-09-08 GUIDE FOR SAFE MACHINERY | SICK 1-7 Subject to change without notice Risk assessment Notes Notes Risk assessment 1 1-8 GUIDE FOR SAFE MACHINERY | SICK 7028282/2014-09-08 Subject to change without notice Risk reduction The 3-step method Risk reduction The 3-step method Steps 2 to 4: Risk reduction If the risk evaluation showed that measures are necessary to reduce the risk, the 3-step method must be used. The 3-step method The following principles shall be applied during the selection of the measures, and in the order given: 1. Safe design: elimination or minimization of residual risks as far as possible (integra- tion of safety in the design and construction of the machine or process) 1 2. Technical protective measures: Take the necessary protective measures (engineer- ing controls) against risks that cannot be eliminated by design 3. Administrative measures to inform and warn about the residual risks Risk reduction by means of safe design End or next 2 Start g
