when the contact block is snapped into place onto the panel. Cable Pull Switches For machinery such as conveyors, it is often more convenient and effective to use a cable pull device along the hazard area as the emergency stop device. These devices use a steel wire rope connected to latching pull switches so that pulling on the rope in any direction at any point along its length will trip the switch and cut off the machine power. The cable pull switches must detect both a pull on the cable as well as when the cable goes slack. Slack detection monitors that the cable has not been cut and is ready for use. Cable distance affects performance of the switch. For short distances, the safety switch is mounted on one end and a tension spring mounted at the other. For longer distances, a safety switch must be mounted at both ends of the cable to ensure that a single action by the operator initiates a stop command. The use of appropriately positioned eye bolts to support and guide the cable is essential The required cable 40 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Implementation of Protective Measures pull force should not exceed 200N (45lbs) or a distance of 400mm (15.75in) at a position centred between two eye bolts. It is important to follow the manufacturerâ€™s instructions to achieve proper operational performance. Two-Hand Controls The use of two-hand controls (also referred to as bi-manual controls) is a common method of preventing access while a machine is in a dangerous condition. Two controls must be operated concurrently (within 0.5 s of each other) to start the machine. This ensures that both hands of the operator are occupied in a safe position (i.e., at the controls) and therefore cannot be in the hazard area. The controls must
