than was possible by means of the categories as described in the I2 O2 first edition of the standard in the form of EN 954-1. These subsystems may differ widely in nature, for example with Simplified logic representation: regard to their technology or Category, and may also be developed against other standards for the safety-related two SRP/CS as subsystems parts of machine controls that are based upon an SIL rather than a PL (see Figure 3.2). A further special case is the integration of subsystems Two-channel and (tested) single-channel parts may alter- that already possess a PL (or SIL) or an average proba- nate in linked subsystems. As an example, Figure 6.14 bility of dangerous failure per hour PFH as blocks in an D shows an encapsulated logic subsystem (e.g. a safety SRP/CS. As an approximate rule without inspection of the PLC) to which two-channel input and output elements are internal structure of the subsystem, the reciprocal of the connected. Since the hardware level is already abstrac- average probability of a dangerous failure per hour PFH D ted in the safety-related block diagram, the order of the may be substituted as the MTTF for the block. Since any D subsystems is in principle interchangeable. It is therefore diagnostics measures of the subsystem that may have recommended that subsystems sharing the same struc- been implemented internally have already been consi- ture be grouped together, as shown in Figure 6.14. This dered in the probability of failure, only supplementary dia- makes calculation of the PL simpler, and unnecessary gnostics measures acting externally upon the subsystem truncation effects, such as multiple capping of the MTTF may be considered for the DC of the block. More detailed D of a channel to 100 years, are avoided. information can be found in clause 2 of
