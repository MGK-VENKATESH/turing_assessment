in turn, disables an actuator. The safety function starts with the command and ends with the implementation. The safety system must be designed with a level of integrity that is commensurate with the risks of the machine. Higher risks require higher integrity levels to ensure the performance of the safety function. Machine safety systems can be classifi ed into levels of performance of their ability to ensure the operation of their safety function or, in other words, their functional safety integrity level. Functional Safety of Control Systems What is Functional Safety? Functional safety is the part of the overall safety requirement and that depends on the correct functioning of the process or equipment in response to its inputs. IEC TR 61508-0 provides the following example to help clarify the meaning of functional safety. “For example, an over-temperature protection device, using a thermal sensor in the windings of an electric motor to de-energize the motor before they can overheat, is an instance of functional safety. But providing specialized insulation to withstand high temperatures is not an instance of functional safety (although it is still an instance of safety and could protect against exactly the same hazard).” As another example, compare hard guarding to an interlocked guard. The hard guarding is not considered “functional safety” although it may protect against access to the same hazard as an interlocked door. The interlocked door is an instance of functional safety. When the guard is opened, the interlock serves as an “input” to a system that achieves a safe state. Similarly, personal protective equipment (PPE) 61 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery is used as a protective measure to help increase safety of personnel. PPE is not considered functional safety. Functional safety was a term introduced in IEC 61508:1998. Since then, the
