and fitting of interlocking devices. Measures are implemented to prevent displacement and reasona- bly foreseeable misuse (see EN ISO 14119). A stable arrangement of the safeguard is assured for actuation of the position switch. 187 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS • S1 satisfies IEC 60947-5-1; short-circuiting between adjacent contacts that are isolated from each other can there- fore be excluded. Despite the warning at start-up and forced dynamics, S1 may stick during inching mode. An addi- tional requirement is therefore that an emergency stop device be installed within the operator‘s reach. • The conditions for fault exclusion for conductor short circuits in accordance with EN ISO 13849-2, Table D.4 must be observed for the connecting lines to S1. Faults in the connecting lines to B1 are detected by monitoring in K4. • The programmable components K1 to K4 satisfy the normative requirements in accordance with subclause 6.3. • G1 is integrated into the closed-loop control circuit (acquisition of the commutation). The encoder G2, which is engineered with diversity, has the purpose of fault detection. • The standard components G1 and G2 are employed in accordance with the information in subclause 6.3.10. • T1 possesses an integrated STO safety function, which satisfies all requirements for Category 3 and PL d. The required fault detection is attained by provision and external monitoring of a feedback signal for STO1 and by inter- nal monitoring measures for STO2. • The bus systems (functional bus, monitoring bus) are employed in accordance with the information in sub- clause 6.2.18. Remarks • This example describes the safeguarding of entrapment points on rotary printing press. For non-cyclical operator intervention in the hazard zone, i.e. less frequently than one intervention per hour, EN 1010-1 requires only one position switch for monitoring of the guard position.
