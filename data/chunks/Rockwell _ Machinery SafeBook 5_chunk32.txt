SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery After all the headings have been addressed the results are entered into the graph or table of whichever risk quantifi cation is being used. This produces some form of quantifi ed estimate of the risks at the various hazards at a machine. This information can then be used to decide which risks need to be reduced in order to achieve an acceptable level of safety. Risk Reduction Now we must consider each machine and its respective risks in turn and take measures to address all of its hazards. Hierarchy of Measures for Risk Reduction There are three basic methods to be considered and used in the following order: 1. Eliminate or reduce risks as far as possible (inherently safe machinery design and construction). 2. Install safeguarding and complementary protective measures in relation to risks that cannot be eliminated by design. 3. Provision of information for safe use including warning signs and signals. Also information of any residual risks and whether any particular training or personal protection equipment is required. Each measure from the hierarchy should be considered starting from the top and used where possible. This will usually result in the use of a combination of measures. Elimination of risk (inherently safe design) At the machine design phase it will be possible to avoid many of the possible hazards simply by careful consideration of factors such as materials, access requirements, hot surfaces, transmission methods, trap points, voltage levels etc. For example, if access is not required to a dangerous area, the solution is to safeguard it within the body of the machine or by some type of fi xed enclosing guard. Protective measures and systems If access is required, then life becomes a little more diffi cult. It will be necessary to
