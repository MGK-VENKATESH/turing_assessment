dangerous failure with practical relevance, the second dangerous failure could then lead to the failure of a Category 4 structure. This is where the new note becomes relevant: Undetected failures with a very low probability (theoretically conceivable, but practically irrelevant) do not need to be factored into the fault accumulation – provided that this fault consideration is documented and verified. 6.2 Subsection 6.1.4: MTTF D The list of possible data sources for estimating an MTTF value has been updated to include a new D option: Reliable field data for identical component applications from similar applications can be used if there are no manufacturer’s details and if the methods in Annex C (including good engineering practice method) are not applicable. 6.3 Subsection 6.1.6: CCF The requirement to avoid common cause failures is now specified in a separate subsection 6.1.6, which refers to the familiar Annex F for guidance on practical implementation. 6.4 Subsection 6.1.7: Systematic failures A separate subsection 6.1.7 has now been added, to provide for the requirement of avoiding and controlling systematic failures. What is new is the express requirement for a functional safety plan that defines functional safety management in order to protect against systematic failures in specification, implementation or modification. The relevant details have been added to Annex G (see section 15 of this article). 6.5 Subsection 6.1.8: Simplified procedure, bar chart and Annex K The simplified procedure for estimating quantifiable aspects of a PL, including the bar chart (now Figure 12 in the standard) can now be found in subsection 6.1.9. There are only two major changes: The requirements on the test rate and the reliability of the test channel now apply generally to Category 2, as mentioned above. Secondly, the authors of the standard have removed the previous edition’s Table 6, which was the bar
