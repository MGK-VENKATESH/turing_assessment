When the guard door is open, unexpected start-up of the motor is prevented in two channels by the interlock safety function (not shown). • The pin of the locking element acts directly upon the direct opening contacts B2.1 and B2.2, which are connected to a safety module K2. • The hazardous movement can be started only when the guard door is closed and guard locking activated, since the enabling circuits of K1 and K2 are connected in series. • Actuation of the stop button causes the contactor relays K4 and K5 to drop out. Once the motor has reached a standstill, guard locking can be opened by actuation of the latching switch S1 (safety function: release of guard locking). The stationary state of the motor is detected by two-channel monitoring B4, K7. Design features • Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. Protective circuits (such as contact protection) as described in the initial paragraphs of Chapter 8 are implemented. • B1 is an electromechanical guard locking device with fail-safe locking element. Fault exclusion can be assumed for the mechanical components of the guard locking device, including mechanical failure of the locking element and the actuator, when the following conditions are met: – Use in accordance with the operating manual, in particular the installation instructions and technical data (e.g. actuating radius, actuating velocity) – Prevention of working loose – The static forces on the guard locking device are lower than the locking force stated on the data sheet – No dynamic forces arise, since current flows through the unlocking solenoid only when the guard door is closed; refer in this context also to DGUV Informative publication 203-079 concerning the selection and fitting of inter- locking devices – The device is not used as
