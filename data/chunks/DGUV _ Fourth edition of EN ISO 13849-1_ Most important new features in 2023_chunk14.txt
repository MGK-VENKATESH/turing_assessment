the validation examples in the Annexes – there are plans to migrate the entire part 2 into part 1 of the standard. Until then, the validation requirements in the two parts of the standard will continue to be compatible, so that there will be no inconsistencies. 9 Section 11: Maintainability of SRP/CS The previous section on maintenance has been extended to include the aspect of maintainability, so that accessibility, ease of use, visibility, simplification and automatically generated maintenance advice are now also included. 10 Sections 12 and 13: Technical documentation and information for use Minor amendments have been made to the previous requirements on the (manufacturer’s in-house) technical documentation, and the requirements on the information for use have been divided into two subsections: the first subsection is for SRP/CS integrators, providing a detailed list of technical parameters, and the second one is for machine users, providing details on operation, displays, cleaning, maintenance, etc. 11 Annex A: Determination of PL r The informative Annex A on the determination of the PL contains two significant changes. r The parameters “possibility of avoiding or limiting harm” (Parameter P) and “probability of occurrence of a hazard event” are no longer merged. The “probability of occurrence of a hazard event” is now merely mentioned in passing and, to be on the safe side, is generally estimated as being high (100%). In cases where a low estimate is possible, the PL that has been determined via the risk graph can be r downgraded by one level. What is new is that this decision must be justified and documented. The fourth edition of the standard no longer specifies how to determine the “probability of occurrence of a hazard event”, so that only edition 3 of the standard can be used for information purposes here, as EN ISO
