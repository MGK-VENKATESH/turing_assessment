The use of complex electronics has enabled the cost effective integration of fault tolerance and a high level of diagnostic coverage into a single device. The interlocking device shown not only achieves Category 4, it also provides an extremely high level of resistance to tampering (overriding) by the use of RFID coding. It can also be connected in series with other similar devices with no lowering of Category or diagnostic coverage. PL (Performance Level) for Component and System Ratings The Designated Architectures (Categories) of (EN) ISO 13849 can be used as part of safety component (device) PL ratings as well as system PL ratings. This generates some confusion that can be clarifi ed by understanding the components and their capabilities. By studying the preceding examples we fi nd that a component such as an interlock switch rated to Category 1 can be used on its own in a Category 1 system. It can also form part of a Category 3 or 4 system if two of the components are used together with a diagnostic function provided by a monitoring safety relay Some components such as monitoring safety relays and
