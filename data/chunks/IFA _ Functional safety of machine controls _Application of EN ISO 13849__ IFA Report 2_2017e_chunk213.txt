S2. For this purpose, the PLC output O1.2 de-energizes the light barrier transmitter in response to a software command. The reaction of the receiver (K2 drops out again) is monitored on the PLC inputs I1.1 and I1.2. Provided the behavi- our is free of faults, K2 locks in via O1.2, and the hazardous movement can be initiated by the releasing of S2. K1 is de-energized via O1.0, and the main contactor relay Q1 actuated via O1.1. • Should a fault in one of the light barriers or in K2 be detected by the test, the outputs O1.1 and O1.2 are deactiva- ted, and an actuating signal is no longer applied to the main contactor relay Q1. • In the event of global failure of the PLC (output O1.0 at low potential, outputs O1.1 and O1.2 at high potential), interruption of a light beam results in de-energization of K2, independently of the PLC. In order to ensure this inde- pendence, the light barrier outputs are decoupled from the PLC by the decoupling diode R2. Under unfavourable circumstances, the light barriers can be re-activated by K2 by actuation of the start button, and the main contactor relay Q1 thus actuated. In this case, (only) the test equipment would have failed. Failure of the test equipment is detected owing to the probability of a functionally defective process under these circumstances. • During the test, actuation of Q1 by K1 and O1.1 is blocked. 124 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS F1 F2 F3 K2 Q1 R2 K3 Design features • Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. Protective circuits (such as contact protection) as described in the initial paragraphs of Chapter 8 are implemented. • Special light barriers with suitable optical characteristics (aperture angle, extraneous light
