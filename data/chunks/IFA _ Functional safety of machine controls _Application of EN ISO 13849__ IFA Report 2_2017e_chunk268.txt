barrier, i.e. whilst sensors F3 and F4 are still activated. • The failure of individual muting sensors is either detected directly by the PLC program (owing to monitoring for proper completion of activation and deactivation), or becomes evident by operating inhibition during transport of the pallet. • Failure of the hold-to-run button S4, which is used only for the clearing of faults (manual muting), is detected directly by the operator. Design features • Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. Protective circuits (such as contact protection) as described in the initial paragraphs of Chapter 8 are implemented. • The contactor relays K1 to K3 possess mechanically linked contact elements in accordance with IEC 60947-5-1, Annex L. • The supply conductors to the light barrier F5 and the hold-to-run button S4 are laid such that short-circuits be tween individual conductors (including to the supply voltage) can be excluded. • The control components S1 to S4 are located at a point outside the hazard zone and from where the hazard zone can be viewed. • The muting state is displayed by two lights clearly visible to the operator at the access point to the hazard zone. • The muting sensors F1 to F4 are standard components and are engineered with electronic hardware without soft- ware. Remarks • Example enabling arrangement for automated material discharge on safeguards of access points to palletization and depalletization equipment, transfer stations, strapping or wrapping machines. The same principle can be used for access points for material infeed. 178 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS • When muting sensors are used that employ microcontrollers and software that have not been subjected to a safety analysis by the manufacturer (i.e. the requirements imposed upon safety-related embedded software are not met), components featuring
