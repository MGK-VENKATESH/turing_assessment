12100 does not provide much information on this risk element, either. On the other hand, more detailed assistance is offered for the determination of parameter P, based on five factors. Three of these factors are each alone sufficient to justify the choice of P2 (avoiding or limitating of harm scarcely possible) if they are unfavourable: the speed with which the hazardous situation arises, the possibility of avoiding the hazard in terms of physical space, and the perceptibility of the hazard. The other two factors only justify the choice of P2 in combination with other unfavourable factors: first, whether the machine is used by skilled persons and, second, the complexity of its operation. 12 Annexes C and D: MTTF values D If the manufacturer of a component with mechanical wear, e.g. a pneumatic or electromechanical component, specifies only a B value instead of a B value (number of cycles until 10% of the 10 10D components have dangerously failed), then the rate of dangerous failures RDF – where known – can be used for the conversion according to the relationship B = B /RDF. Up to now, there has only 10D 10 been the indication that 50% dangerous failures should be assumed as an estimate, i.e. B = 2 * B . 10D 10 However, even in the new edition of the standard, the additional condition applies that the T value is 10D limited to a maximum of 2 * T where the RDF is below 50%. This increases the B value (and the 10 10D MTTF value derived from it) for a small ratio of dangerous failures, but not the T value, i.e. the time D 10D after which a component with mechanical wear must be replaced in order to maintain the identified PL.
