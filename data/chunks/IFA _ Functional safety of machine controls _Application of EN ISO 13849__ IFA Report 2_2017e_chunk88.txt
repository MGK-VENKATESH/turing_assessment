be possible, the accumulation of undetected faults must For simplified quantification of the probability of failure, not result in loss of the safety function. (In practice, presentation of the safety-related control in the form of abstracted blocks and channels is helpful. The term 53 6 Design of safe control systems “blocks” has a defined meaning of its own in this con- Figure 6.9: text. It refers to function blocks only in the sense that the General example of a safety-related block diagram; I1 and O1 safety function is executed in smaller units arranged in constitute the first channel (series arrangement), whilst I2, L series and in parallel. The following rules can be stated and O2 constitute the second (series arrangement); the safety for mapping of the hardware structure to a safety-related function is performed redundantly with both channels (parallel arrangement); T is used only for testing block diagram: • The blocks should map, in abstract form, all control II11 OO11 Series arrangement components that relate to performance of the safety SB1 Parallel arrangement function. II22 LL OO22 Series arrangement • If the safety function is performed in multiple redundant TT only for testing channels, they should be presented in separate blocks. Subsystem 2 (SB2) This reflects the fact that should one block fail, perfor- mance of the safety function by the blocks of the other channel is not impaired. In accordance with this definition, the following rules can be formulated for presentation of a safety-related control • Division of the blocks within a channel is somewhat system in the form of a safety-related block diagram: arbitrary; although EN ISO 13849-1 proposes three blocks per channel (input level I, logic level L and output • The arrangement of blocks in series in the form of a level O), this is primarily
