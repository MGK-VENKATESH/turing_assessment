This value represents a theoretical parameter expressing the probability of a dangerous failure of a component (not the entire subsystem) within the lifetime of that component. The actual lifetime of the subsystem is always shorter. The MTTF value can be derived from the failure rates.

Their maximum lifetime depends on 10 the wear and the switching frequency. B therefore indicates the number of switching cycles until 10% of the 10 components fail. • The B value is concerned with the dangerous failure of components (the “D” in B stands for “danger‐ 10D 10D ous”). The value indicates the number of switching cycles until 10% of the components fail dangerously. If the B value is not specified, it may generally be assumed that: B = 2 × B 10D 10D 10 • The failure rate λ applies to electronic components. Often the failure rate is given in FIT (Failures In Time). FIT=1 means one failure per 109 hours. ISO 13849-1 combines the MTTF values into ranges: D Table 54: Ranges of the MTTF value according to ISO 13849-1 D Designation Range Low 3 years ≤ MTTF < 10 years D Medium 10 years ≤ MTTF < 30 years D High 30 years ≤ MTTF < 100 years D The mean time to a dangerous failure in years (MTTF ) can be calculated for the overall system from the D component values. To avoid overrating the impact of reliability, the useful maximum value for the MTTF has been limited to D 100 years. ]%[ eruliaf suoregnad a fo ytilibaborP 100% Unacceptable MTTF D 80% Low MTTF D Medium MTTF D 60% 40% High MTTF D
