interference immunity. The following article provides a detailed presentation of the main changes and, where necessary, recommendations for interpretation. Fourth Edition of EN ISO 13849-1 (July 2023) 1 / 12 Illustration: Major changes to the design process for SRP/CS in the fourth edition of the standard 1 Introduction Regarding the scope of the standard, a new note clarifies that its content is geared towards stationary machinery, although other types of machinery, such as mobile machinery, are also expressly covered. The position of the standard in the iterative process of risk reduction under EN ISO 12100 is now presented in more detail. The informative Annex A of the standard can be used in this context to determine the required performance level (PL) unless it is specified in a product standard (type-C r standard). Unlike the preceding version, this edition of the standard specifies in more detail that it can also be used, for instance, for the integration of logic units and electro-sensitive protective equipment into safety-related parts of control systems (SRP/CS) as well as for the design of subsystems using safety components, such as two-hand control devices, interlocking devices, relays, valves, position sensors and enable switches. The reference to Technical Report ISO/TR 23849 [2] on the application of ISO 13849-1 and IEC 62061 – withdrawn in 2020 – was deleted. That content is now included in the current editions of both standards. Both standards have been harmonised under the Machinery Directive and can be used for the design and integration of safety-related control systems of machinery (including software) (see also below, section 6). Concerning the adoption of validation requirements from part 2 of the standard in section 10, the authors clarify that the more recent requirements from part 1 take priority during the transitional period until the revision of EN ISO
