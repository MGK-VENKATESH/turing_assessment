will be fault detection in the functional channel instead of the checking of the safety function. This clarifies that what is required is not necessarily the checking of the entire sub-function of a Category 2 subsystem (which might be interpreted as 100% fault detection), but that effective fault detection is required in the functional channel – and indeed for each of its parts (input unit, logic and output unit), at least with “low” diagnostic coverage (DC), i.e. 60% fault detection. Two conditions were previously mentioned only in the context of the simplified procedure for estimating the quantifiable aspects of the PL. They now apply generally under Category 2: Fourth Edition of EN ISO 13849-1 (July 2023) 5 / 12 The test rate must be at least 100 times higher than the demand rate, or testing occurs immediately upon demand of the safety function and prevents the hazard. This does not affect the exceptional case in Appendix K where a test rate is described that is only 25 times higher. Also, the mean time to dangerous failure (MTTF ) of the test channel (including OTE, output of test D equipment) must be greater than half the MTTF of the entire functional channel. D • Fault accumulation in Category 4 (6.1.3.2.6) A new note has been added to clear up a possible misunderstanding when implementing Category 4. In a failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA), it is sometimes impossible to classify 100% of theoretically possible dangerous failures as detectable. This is why “only” a high DC of 99% is required for PFH calculation in Category 4. On the other hand, according to the definition of Category 4, the accumulation of (up to two) undetected dangerous failures must not lead to the loss of the safety function. If there were indeed an undetected
