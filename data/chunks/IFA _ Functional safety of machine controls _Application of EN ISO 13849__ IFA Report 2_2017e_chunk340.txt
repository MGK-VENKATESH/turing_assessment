Firstly, the total failure rate is distributed between the various failure types (e.g. open circuit, short circuit, For components intended to enhance the circuit‘s resis- drift, change in function).

Typical advantageous to distinguish between two possible cases failure type distributions can also be found in commercial for assessment of the function block‘s behaviour. If the FMEDA software.
