The monitoring safety relay (MSR) provides fault diagnostics for the tongue interlock switch and for the contactors. The MSR can also facilitate other functionality such as a manual reset. In terms of their internal architecture monitoring safety relays are usually PLe or SIL3. The two contactors should have overload and short-circuit protection. The probability of the contactor failing with welded contacts is small but not impossible. A contactor can 101 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery also fail due to its power switching contacts staying closed due to a stuck armature. If one contactor fails to a dangerous state, the second contactor will still continue to function and will remove power from the motor. The MSR will detect the faulted contactor upon the next machine cycle. When the gate is closed and the start button pressed, the mechanically linked contacts of the faulted contactor will remain open and the MSR will not be able to close its safety contacts, thereby, revealing the fault Undetected Faults With a Category 3 system structure there may be some faults that cannot be detected but they must not, by themselves, lead to the loss of the safety function. Where faults can be detected we need to know if, under some circumstances, they could be either masked or unintentionally cleared by the operation of other devices within the system structure. +V SCP K1 L1 L2 L3 Aux Wiring Fault in the System Start K2 SCP Aux Sw1 Sw2 Sw3 Ch2 Stop K1 Ch1 Monitoring Ch1 K2 Safety Relay Ch2 OP TS K1 K2 TS Motor (Hazard) Gnd Contactors Series Connection of Input Devices Shown here is a widely used approach for connecting multiple devices to a monitoring safety relay.
