or type 4 interlocking device is the only interlocking device on a physical guard, it must meet the requirements of IEC 60947-5-3. Manipulation prevention When designing interlocking devices, designers shall consider the possible motivation for manipulation of the protective device and foreseeable manipulation into account. Measures to counter manipulation with simple means shall be applied. Simple means include screws, needles, sections of sheet steel, coins, bent wire or the like. Possible means of avoiding simple attempts to manipulate interlocking devices include: • Making interlocking devices difficult to access by using concealed assembly or assembly out of reach • Using position switches with coded actuators • Mounting the elements of the interlocking switches with “one-way” fasteners (e.g., safety screws, rivets) • Manipulation monitoring in the control system (plausibility checks, testing) 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 65 Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION Redundant design The critical failure of an individual safety switch can be caused by manipulation, a mechanical error on the actuator or position switch (e.g., aging), or the effects of extreme ambient conditions (food industry example: stuck roller plunger due to contamination with flour). In particular at higher safety levels it is necessary to use an additional position switch, e.g., with the opposite function to that of the first position switch, and to have both switches monitored by the control system. Example: An injection molding machine with cyclically actuated front protective doors. This application requires two mechanical switches. Table 24: Example: Detection of mechanical faults by means of a diverse redundant arrangement Locking devices Locking devices are devices that prevent guards from opening. They shall be applied if the stopping time of the dangerous machine state is longer than the time a person needs to reach the hazardous area
