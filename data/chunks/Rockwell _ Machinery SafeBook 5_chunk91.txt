3 years <= MTTF < 10 years D Medium 10 years <= MTTF < 30 years D High 30 years <= MTTF < 100 years D Levels of MTTF D Note that (EN) ISO 13849-1 limits the usable MTTF of a single channel of a D subsystem to a maximum of 100 years even though the actual values derived may be much higher As we will see later, the achieved range of MTTF average is then combined D with the designated architecture Category and the diagnostic coverage [DC] to provide a preliminary PL rating. The term preliminary is used here because other requirements including systematic integrity and measures against common cause failure still have to be met where relevant. Methods of Data Determination We now need to delve one stage deeper into how a manufacturer determines the data either in the form of PFH or MTTF . An understanding of this is essential D D when dealing with manufacturers data. Components can be grouped into three basic types: â€¢ Mechanistic (Electro-mechanical, mechanical, pneumatic, hydraulic etc) â€¢ Electronic (i.e. solid state) â€¢ Software There is a fundamental difference between the common failure mechanisms of these three technology types. In basic form it can be summarised as follows:- Mechanistic Technology: Failure is proportional to both the inherent reliability and the usage rate. The greater the usage rate, the more likely that one of the component parts may be degraded and fail. Note that this is not the only failure cause, but unless we limit the operation time/cycles it will be the predominant one. It is self evident that a contactor that has switching cycle of once per ten seconds will operate reliably for a far shorter time than an identical contactor that operates one per day. 78 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 System Design
