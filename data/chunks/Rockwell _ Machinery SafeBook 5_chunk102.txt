operation, required response time, operating modes, duty cycles, operating environment, and fault reaction functions. The safety integrity requirements are expressed in levels called safety integrity levels (SIL). Depending on the complexity of the system, some or all of the elements in the table below must be considered to determine whether the system design meets the required SIL. Element for SIL Consideration Symbol Probability of Dangerous Failure per Hour PFH D Hardware Fault Tolerance HFT Safe Failure Fraction SFF Proof Test Interval T1 Diagnostic Test Interval T2 Susceptibility to Common Cause Failures β Diagnostic Coverage DC Elements for SIL Consideration Subsystems The term “subsystem” has a special meaning in IEC/EN 62061. It is the fi rst level subdivision of a system into parts which, if they fail, would cause a failure of the safety function. Therefore if two redundant switches are used in a system neither individual switch is a subsystem. The subsystem would comprise both switches and any associated fault diagnostic function. 87 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery Probability of Dangerous Failure per Hour (PFH ) D IEC/EN 62061 uses the same basic methods as discussed in the section on (EN) ISO 13849-1 to determine failure rates at the component level. The same provisions and methods apply for “mechanistic” and electronic components. In IEC/EN 62061 there is no consideration of MTTF in years. The failure rate per hour (λ) is either D calculated directly or obtained or derived from the B10 value by the following formula: λ = 0.1 x C/B10 (where C = the number of operating cycles per hour) There is a signifi cant difference between the standards in the methodology for determining the total PFH for a subsystem or system. An analysis of the D components must be undertaken to determine the probability
