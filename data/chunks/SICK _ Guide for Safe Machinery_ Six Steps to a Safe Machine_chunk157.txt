Accordingly, the SFF = 30 % + 69.3 % = 99.3 %. λ D 142 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 3D – VERIFYING THE SAFETY FUNCTION Example: Determining the SIL and PFH of the “power control elements” subsystem D 5) Evaluation of the measures to prevent common cause failures Value CCF factor (β) Measures to avoid the common cause effect are required in multi- ≤ 35 10% channel systems.

This knowledge and practical experience is available to you in SICK's service and training portfolio (see "How SICK supports you", page 161).
