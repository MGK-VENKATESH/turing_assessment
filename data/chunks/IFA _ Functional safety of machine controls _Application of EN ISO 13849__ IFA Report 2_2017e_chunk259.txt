by the process results in a DC of 60% for T1stop, and in combination with internal self-tests avg in a DC of 60% for K4. Testing of the timing element with the FI de-energized results in a DC of 99% for K1. Testing of the timing element with the FI de-energized in combination with fault detection by comparison in the FI at a demand of the safety function results in a DC of 90% for C1. For S4.1, S4.2 and K2, DC is 99% owing to plausibility testing in K4. An adequate test rate of the emergency-stop device is assured (refer to the information in subclauses 6.2.14 and D.2.5.1). The averaging formula for DC returns a result of 65% (“low”). avg • Adequate measures against common cause failure (85 points): separation (15), diversity (20), overvoltage protec- tion etc. (15) and environmental conditions (25 + 10) • The combination of the control elements satisfies Category 3 with a high MTTF of each channel (72 years) and D a low DC (65%). Together with the FI T1, this results in an average probability of dangerous failure PFH of avg D 1.7 · 10-7 per hour. This satisfies PL d. Safe stop initiated by the ESPE K3: • The ESPE K3 is available as a commercial safety component. Its probability of failure PFH is 3.0 · 10-8 per hour [M], D and is added at the end of the calculation. • The probability of failure of the “PLC/electromechanical” two-channel structure is calculated using the same MTTF D and DC values as above. The component K2 however is not involved in performance of this safety function. The results are: an MTTF for each channel of 72 years (“high”) and a DC of 65% (“low”). For Category 3, this yields an D avg average probability
