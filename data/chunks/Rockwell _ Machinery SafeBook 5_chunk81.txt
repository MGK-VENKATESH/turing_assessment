concept design stage. It cannot be completely covered by the standard because the standard does not know about all the characteristics of a specifi c application. This also often applies to the machine builder who produces the machine but does not necessarily know the exact conditions under which it will be used. The standard does provide some help by listing out many of the commonly used safety functions (e.g. safety-related stop function initiated by safeguard, muting function, start/restart function) and providing some normally associated requirements. Study of (EN) ISO 12100: ”Basic design principles and Risk assessment” is recommended for use at this stage. ISO TR 22100-2 provides useful guidance on the relationship between the machine risk assessment process from ISO 12100 and the PL allocation process of (EN) ISO 13849-1. There is a large range of machine specifi c standards that will provide safety function requirements for specifi c machines. Within the European EN standards they are termed C type standards, some of them have exact equivalents in ISO standards. ISO TR 22100-1 provides further information on the relationship between ISO 12100 and C standards. It is clear that the safety concept design stage is dependent on the type of machine and also on the characteristics of the application and environment in which it is used. The machine builder must anticipate these factors in order to be able to design the safety concept. The intended [i.e. anticipated] conditions of use should be given in the user manual. The user of the machine needs to check that they match the actual usage conditions. The PLr is used to denote what performance level is required by the safety function and this is determined during the Risk Assessment. In order to determine the PLr the standard provides a risk graph into which the
