as an encapsulated subsystem with Category 3, PL d and a PFH of 1.5 · 10-10 per hour. D • The safety-related stop function and the safely limited speed are engineered as a continuous Category 3 subsys- tem comprising B1.1/B1.2, G2/G1 and K1 to K4, which is combined with T1 to form an encapsulated Category 3 sub- system. For the first subsystem, a medium MTTF per channel of 14.5 years and a medium DC of 91% yield a PFH D avg D of 7.1 · 10-7 per hour. Combination with T1 (PFH = 1.5 · 10-10 per hour) yields a PFH of 7.1 · 10-7 per hour for both safety D D functions. This satisfies PL d. • Inching mode is implemented by a combination of the Category 2 subsystem S1 (PFH = 5.3 · 10-7 per hour) with D the two Category 3 subsystems comprising T1 (PFH = 1.5 · 10-10 per hour) and G2/G1 together with K1 to K4. With D a medium MTTF per channel of 14.5 years and a medium DC of 91%, the second Category 3 subsystem attains D avg a PFH of 7.1 · 10-7 per hour. Combination of the three subsystems yields a PFH of 1.2 · 10-6 per hour. This satisfies D D PL c.
