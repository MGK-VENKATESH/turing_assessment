The best solution is an inherently safe design. Instructional measures such as user information harbor the risk of non-compliance and are thus only permissible as supplement once all technical options to improve safety have been exhausted. Technical measures present an additional route. Preventive technical measures If a machine’s safety depends on a properly functioning control, this can be termed “functional safety”. The “active” parts of the control are the main focus, i.e. components that detect a dangerous situation (signal recording, “I” = input), derive suitable reactions (evaluation, “L” = logic), and implement reliable measures (execution, “O” = output). The term “control” thus refers to the entire signal processing system. Note: “Safety-related parts of control systems” are not necessarily “safety components” as defined by the Machinery Directive.
