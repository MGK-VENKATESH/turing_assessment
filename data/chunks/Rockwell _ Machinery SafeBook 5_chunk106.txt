subsystems according to IEC/EN 62061 life becomes much easier because the specifi c requirements for the design of subsystems do not apply. These requirements will, in general, be covered by the device (subsystem) manufacturer and are much more complex than those required for system level design. IEC/EN 62061 requires that complex subsystems such as safety PLCs comply with IEC 61508 or other appropriate standards. This means that, for devices using complex electronic or programmable components, the full rigor of IEC 61508 applies. This can be a very rigorous and involved process. For example, 90 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 System Design According to IEC/EN 62061 the evaluation of the PFH achieved by a complex subsystem can be a very D complicated process using techniques such as Markov modelling, reliability block diagrams or fault tree analysis. IEC/EN 62061 does give requirements for the design of lower complexity subsystems. Typically this would include relatively simple electrical components such as interlock switches and electromechanical safety monitoring relays. The requirements are not as involved as those in IEC 61508 but can still be quite complicated. IEC/EN 62061 supplies four subsystem logical architectures with accompanying formulae that can be used to evaluate the PFH achieved by a low complexity D subsystem. These architectures are purely logical representations and should not be thought of as physical architectures. The four subsystem logical architectures with accompanying formulae are shown in the following four diagrams. For a basic subsystem architecture shown below, the probabilities of dangerous failures are simply added together. Subsystem A Subsystem Subsystem element 1 element n De1 Den Subsystem logical architecture A λDssA = λDe1 + ....+ λDen PFHDssA = λDssA λ Lambda is used to designate the failure rate. The units of the failure rate are failures per hour. λD, Lambda sub D is the dangerous failure
