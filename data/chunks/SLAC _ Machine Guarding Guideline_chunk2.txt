started until the guard is back in place. 19 July 2021 SLAC-I-730-0A21T-016-R003 2 of 12 SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory Environment, Safety & Health Division Machine and Portable Tools | Machine Safeguarding Guideline 2.1.3 Adjustable An adjustable guard provides a barrier that may be adjusted to facilitate a variety of production operations. Adjustable guards are useful because they allow flexibility in accommodating various sizes of stock, but, because they require adjusting, they are subject to human error. 2.1.4 Self-adjusting A self-adjusting guard provides a barrier that moves according to the size of the stock entering the danger area. Self-adjusting guards avoid the potential for human error associated with adjustable guards. 19 July 2021 SLAC-I-730-0A21T-016-R003 3 of 12 SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory Environment, Safety & Health Division Machine and Portable Tools | Machine Safeguarding Guideline 2.2 Safety Devices A safety device may perform one of several functions:  It may stop the machine if a hand or any part of the body is inadvertently placed in the danger area.  It may restrain or withdraw the operator's hands from the danger area during operation.  It may require the operator to use both hands on machine controls, thus keeping both hands and body out of danger.  It may provide a barrier that is synchronized with the operating cycle of the machine in order to prevent entry to the danger area during the hazardous part of the cycle. 2.2.1 Presence Sensing Presence-sensing devices: radio frequency (capacitance) (left); photoelectrical (optical) (right) A presence-sensing device uses a system of light or radio beam (capacitance) sources and controls that can interrupt the machine's operating cycle. If the sensing field is broken, the machine stops and will not cycle. This device must be used only on machines that can be stopped before the worker can reach
