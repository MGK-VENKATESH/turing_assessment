measures) Sensors for monitoring machine parameters The risk assessment may show that certain machine param- eters shall be monitored and detected during operation. Safe position monitoring Safety-related sensors or position switches can be used to pre- vent a machine overrunning or leaving a specific position (g 3-5). Electro-sensitive safety inductive position switches are par- ticularly suitable for this task. They monitor a certain part of the process (e.g., robot’s axis or a moving part of a machine) for presence without the need for a specific mating element, without wear, and with a high enclosure rating. 3 Safe position monitoring for a lift on an automobile production line c Monitoring of rotation, speed, overrun Encoders or travel measurement systems are used to detect and evaluate rotation, speed, and overrun. The signals from encoders can be used in automated guided vehicles to adapt the protective field size of safety laser scan- ners to the speed at which the vehicles are moving. Safe standstill or rotation evaluation modules monitor the movement of drives using sensors or rotary encoders to generate a safe control signal at standstill or on deviation from preset parameters. If safety-related requirements are more stringent, either safety encoders or redundant encoders shall be used. Another possibility is to monitor the voltage induced by residual magnetism on a motor that is spinning down.
