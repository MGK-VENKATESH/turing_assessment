ready to be Reset. The online diagnostics mode of the 440C-CR30 relay can be very helpful during the verifi cation process. 10. Review the information in Calculation of the Performance Level and Verifi cation and Validation Plan before proceeding with Verifi cation of the Confi guration Calculation of the Performance Level When properly implemented, this safety-related stop function can achieve a safety rating of Category 4, Performance Level e (CAT. 4, PLe), according to ISO 13849-1: 2008, as calculated by using the SISTEMA software PL calculation tool. The minimum Performance Level required (PLr) from the risk assessment for this safety function is PLd. 127 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery This safety-related stop initiated by a safeguard safety function can be modelled as follows: INPUT LOGIC OUTPUT 100S K1 SensaGuard CR 30 100S K2 Subsystem 1 Subsystem 2 Subsystem 3 Because these are electro-mechanical devices, the safety contactors data includes the following : • Mean Time to Failure, dangerous (MTTF ) D • Diagnostic Coverage (DCavg ) • Common Cause Failure (CCF) Electro-mechanical devices’ functional safety evaluations include the following: • How frequently they are operated • Whether they are effectively monitored for faults • Whether they are properly specifi ed and installed 128 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Application Examples SISTEMA calculates the MTTFd by using B10d data provided for the contactors, along with the estimated frequency of use, entered during the creation of the SISTEMA project. The DCavg (99%) for the contactors is selected from the Output Device table of ISO 13849-1 Annex E, Direct Monitoring. The CCF value is generated by using the scoring process outlined in Annex F of ISO 13849-1. The complete CCF scoring process must be performed when actually implementing an application. A minimum score of 65 must be achieved. Verifi cation and
