60947-5-1, Annex K. • The safety module K2 satisfies all requirements for Category 4 and PL e. • The supply conductors to the position switches are laid separately or with protection. • A standard PLC without safety functions is employed for K1. • The valves 1V3, 1V4 and 1V5 possess a closed centre position/closed position with sufficient overlap, spring- centred central position/return, and position monitoring. • The safety-oriented switching position is assumed from any position by cancellation of the control signal. • The pressure-relief valve 1V6 for protecting the cylinder 1A and the components below it against the effect of the pressure ratio satisfies the requirements of EN 693:2001, subclause 5.2.4.4. Calculation of the probability of failure • K2 is considered as a subsystem with a probability of failure of 2.3 · 10-9 per hour [M]. The remaining part of the control system is grouped separately by electromechanical and hydraulic components to form two Category 4 sub- systems, the probability of failure of which is calculated below. • MTTF : for the position switch B1 with direct opening action, the B is 20 · 106 switching cycles [M]. For the electri- D 10D cal make contact of the position switch B2, the B is 1,000,000 switching cycles [M]. At 365 working days, 16 wor- 10D king hours per day and a cycle time of 10 minutes, n is 35,040 cycles per year for these components, and the op MTTF is 5,707 years for B1 and 285 for B2. An MTTF of 150 years [M] is assumed for each of the valves 1V3, 1V4 and D D 1V5. This yields an MTTF value per channel of 100 and 88 years (“high”) respectively for the two subsystems.
