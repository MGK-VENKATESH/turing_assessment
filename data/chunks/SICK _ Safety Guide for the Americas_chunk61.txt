enabling button engaged and +/- buttons actuated (see figure) Combining or switching safety functions A machine can adopt various states or work in various operat- ing modes. During this process, different safety measures may be effective or different safety functions coupled together. By means of control functions, it must be ensured that the required level of safety is always achieved. Switching between operating modes or the selection and adjustment of different safety measures shall not lead to a dangerous state. Examples: • After a change of operating mode between setup and nor- mal operation, the machine is stopped. A new manual start command is necessary. • Adapting the monitored area of a laser scanner to the speed of the vehicle (see figure) 3-6 GUIDE FOR SAFE MACHINERY | SICK 7028282/2014-09-08 Subject to change without notice Risk reduction Technical protective measures Emergency stop Emergency stop is a complementary protective measure and not considered a primary safeguard because it does not pre- vent or detect access to a hazard point. However, an emergency stop can be used to further reduce risk. The safety level of this function shall be defined based on the risk assessment of the machine. In particular, influencing environmental factors (e.g., vibration, method of actuation, etc.) shall be considered (see also section “Actions in an emer- 1 gency” g 3-43). - See NFPA 79, ANSI B11.19, IEC 60204-1 and ISO 13850 Safety-relevant indications and alarms Safety-related indications are means of providing the user with 3 information about impending hazards (e.g., overspeed, pre- start warning) or possible residual risks. These kind of signals a can also be used to warn the operator before automatic protec- tive measures are initiated. • Warning devices must be designed and arranged so that they can be easily checked and inspected • The warning equipment
