A. Electromagnetic immunity requirements from an applicable product standard have the highest priority (independent of the PL that is to be achieved) and override the general requirements of the generic standard. B. For PL a and PL b, compliance with the lower immunity requirements of IEC 61000-6-2 [9] for industrial settings that are not designed for functional safety is considered sufficient. C. Up to PL d (and even up to PL e if the requirements for category 4 are met), the necessary immunity can also be achieved through protective measures at the system level, such as shielding, filters, interference-resistant cables, separation, fault detection or risk analysis, instead of through interference immunity tests. This alternative verification strategy is also expressly mentioned in IEC 61000-6-7, 4.1, Note 1. Table L.1 of the standard lists 23 different measures for this purpose, with compliance resulting in 10 to 30 points. The immunity requirements are considered to be met if the total score for two-channel systems (Categories 2, 3 and 4) is at least 280, or if the total score for single-channel systems (Categories B and 1) is at least 230. Five measures are not applicable to single-channel subsystems. Eight of the listed measures are marked as strongly recommended: If they are applicable but have not been implemented, detailed justification must be provided as to how immunity is to be achieved in an equivalent manner. D. Up to PL e, compliance with the increased immunity levels can be demonstrated by applying IEC 61000-6-7 or other general EMC standards on functional safety, such as IEC 61326-3-1. 17 Annex O: Device types A new Annex O defines four device types and associated characteristic values, which must be specified, for example, in the manufacturerâ€™s data sheet. While subsystems (device types 1 and 4) are usually specified in terms
