suspended for a limited time while the material passes through (muting) • Horizontal light curtains with integrated algorithm for per- son/material differentiation (see figure) • Protective field switching on a safety laser scanner - For more detailed information, see section “Safety functions that can be integrated in ESPE” g 3-35. Monitoring machine parameters 3 In some applications it is necessary to monitor various machine a parameters for safety-related limits. If a limit is exceeded, suit- able measures are initiated (e.g., stop, warning signal). Examples: • Monitoring of speed, temperature, or pressure • Position monitoring (see figure) 7028282/2014-09-08 GUIDE FOR SAFE MACHINERY | SICK 3-5 Subject to change without notice Technical protective measures Risk reduction Disabling safety functions manually and for a limited time Certain operations, such as set-up or process monitoring, may require the machine to operate with a guard displaced or re- moved and/or a protective device disabled. In these instances, additional measures must be provided for risk reduction and may only be allowed if the follow conditions are met: • An operating mode selector switch capable of supervisory control (e.g., key switch) with a corresponding operating posi- 1 tion shall be used • Automatic control shall be disabled and there shall be no movement of the machine due to direct or indirect activation of sensors • No linked sequences shall be possible • Hazardous machine functions shall only be possible with hold-to-run controls (devices requiring sustained action, such as two-hand control or enabling devices) • Hazardous machine functions are only permitted under reduced risk conditions (e.g., limitation of speed, force, movement distance, duration of function) • All individuals exposed to the hazardous machine function 3 must be provided with and be in direct control of their own control device a Example: • Movement only at reduced speed with
