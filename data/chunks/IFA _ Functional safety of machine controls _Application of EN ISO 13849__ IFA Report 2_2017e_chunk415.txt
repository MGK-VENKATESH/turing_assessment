This value must be determined from demonstrated by comprehensive test calculations. The the system structure, the failure rates of the components, same applies to the relationship, permitted in sub- the level of diagnostic coverage provided by automatic clause 4.5.4 of the standard, between the MTTF values D testing, the mission time of the system, and in the case of of the test and functional channels in the Category 2 relevant system structures, the sensitivity of the system to architecture: the MTTF of the test channel must be at D CCF (common cause failure). least half the MTTF of the functional channel. Finally, a D requirement is imposed for redundant structures that Mathematical models are employed for this purpose common cause failures be reduced to an appropriate that take account of the combined effect of the stated level: no more than 2% of the dangerous failures may factors and return the result in the form of the PFH (as have a common cause. This must be demonstrated in D an average value over the mission time). In theory, a each case during application of the standard by means of custom model should be created for each system under a simple estimation method (Annex F). analysis when the standard is applied. For some common structural variants, the “designated architectures” of The Markov models upon which the bar chart in EN ISO EN ISO 13849-1, subclause 6.2, (cf. subclauses 6.2.1 to 13849-1 (and Figure G.1 of this report) is based take 6.2.7 of this report), Markov models have been developed account of operation of the systems under underlying con- at the IFA the numerical results of
