safety function. One of the following measures must therefore be implemented: • The signal must be discretely wired to the safety-related logic unit. • The signal must be transmitted via a safety-related bus system. The reset shall not initiate any movement or hazardous situation. Instead, the machine control system shall only accept a separate start command after the reset. 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 111 Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION An exception to the application of reset and restart exists if protective devices are used that allow continu‐ ous detection of at-risk persons in the hazardous area (e.g., presence detection). Figure 93: In this arrangement, it is not possible to remain in the hazardous area without being detected by the protective device. Therefore, a separate reset of the protective device is not necessary. Integration of protective devices in the control system Along with mechanical aspects, a protective device must also be integrated in the control system. NOTE "Control systems are functional assemblies that form part of the information system of a machine and implement logical functions. They coordinate the flows of material and energy to the area of action of the tool and workpiece system in the context of a task. […] control systems differ in terms of the technology used, i.e., the information carriers, fluid, electrical and electronic control systems." Translation of text from: Alfred Neudörfer: Konstruieren sicherheitsgerechter Produkte, Springer-Verlag, Berlin u. a., ISBN 978-3-642-33889-2 (5th Edition 2013) The general term control system describes the entire chain of a control system. The control system comprises input elements, logic units, power control elements, and drive/actuator elements. Safety-related parts of the control system are designed to perform safety functions. For this reason special requirements are placed on their reliability and
