For this purpose, use the risk graph (3.) under "Safety function – PLr" (2.), or enter the PL is directly, for instance when it is specified by a machine-specific standard. r 11.. 22.. 33..

Enter them (4.) directly below the subsystem (1.) in the "PL" tab (2.) after selecting "Enter PL / PFH directly" (3.) (Figure 11). The Category can be entered in the next tab, "Category". Since the PL and PFH are available for this subsystem, it is not necessary to enter the Cate- gory for calculation of the PFH of the safety function as a whole. Note: If the box (4.) is checked, the PL and PFH are calculated from each other by means of mean values. Fault exclusion: In encapsulated systems in which all hazardous component faults are excluded, check the "Failure exclusion" box ( PFH=0). 22.. 11.. 33.. 44..
