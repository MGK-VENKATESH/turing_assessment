rate. λDssA, Lambda sub DssA is the dangerous failure rate of subsystem λ. Lambda sub DssA is the sum of the failure rates of the individual elements, e1, e2, e3, up to and including en. The probability of dangerous failure is multiplied by 1 hour to create the probability of failure within one hour. The next diagram shows a single fault tolerant system without a diagnostic function. When the architecture includes single fault tolerance, the potential for common cause failure exists and must be considered. The derivation of the common cause failure is briefl y described later in this chapter. 91 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery Subsystem B Subsystem element 1 De1 Common cause Subsystem failure element 2 De2 Subsystem logical architecture B DssB = (1-β)2 x ʎDe1 x ʎDe2 x T1 + β x (ʎDe1 + ʎDe2) / 2 PFHDssB = ʎDssB The formulae for this architecture takes into account the parallel arrangement of the subsystem elements and adds the following two elements from the previous table ‘Elements for SIL Consideration’. β - the susceptibility to common cause failures (Beta) T1 - the proof test interval or lifetime, whichever is smaller. The proof test is designed to detect faults and degradation of the safety subsystem so that the subsystem can be restored to an operating condition. In practical terms this usually means replacement (like the equivalent term “mission time” in (EN) ISO 13849-1). The next diagram shows the functional representation of a zero fault tolerant system with a diagnostic function. Diagnostic coverage is used to decrease the probability of dangerous hardware failures. The diagnostic tests are performed automatically. The defi nition of diagnostic coverage is the same as given in (EN) ISO 13849-1 i.e. the ratio of the rate of detected dangerous failures compared to
