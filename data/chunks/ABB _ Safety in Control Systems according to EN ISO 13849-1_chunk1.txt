Safety in control systems according to EN ISO 13849-1 Machine Safety - Jokab Safety products New standards for safety in control systems Building a protection system that works in practice and provides sufficient safety requires expertise in several areas. The design of the safety functions in the protection system in order to ensure they provide sufficient reliability is a key ingredient. As help for this there is, for example, the EN ISO 13849-1 standard. With this document we aim to provide an introduction to the standard and its application in conjunction with our products. Introducing the new standard What is PL (Performance Level)? The generation change for standards on safety in control PL is a measure of the reliability of a safety function. PL is systems introduces new concepts and calculations for divided into five levels (a-e). PL e gives the best reliability and machine builders and machine users. The EN 954-1 standard is equivalent to that required at the highest level of risk. (categories) is being phased out and replaced by EN ISO To calculate which level the PL system achieves you 13849-1 (PL, Performance Level) and EN 62061 (SIL, Safety need to know the following: Integrity Level). Although the deadline for using EN 954-1 is • The system’s structure (categories B, 1-4) set to 31/12/2011, it is beneficial to start applying the new • The Mean Time To dangerous Failure of the component standards as soon as possible as many new standards no (MTTF longer refer to EN 954-1. d) • The system’s Diagnostic Coverage (DC) PL or SIL? What should I use? You will also need to: • protect the system against a failure that knocks out both The standard you should use depends on the choice of channels (CCF) technology, experience and customer requirements. • protect
