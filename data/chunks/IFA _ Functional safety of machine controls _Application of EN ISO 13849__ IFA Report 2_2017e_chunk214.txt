immunity, etc.) to IEC 61496-2 are employed. • Several light barriers can be cascaded and monitored by only two PLC inputs and a relay or contactor relay. • The contactor relays K1 and K2 possess mechanically linked contact elements in accordance with IEC 60947-5-1, Annex L. The main contactor relay Q1 possesses a mirror contact in accordance with IEC 60947-4-1, Annex F. • The standard components F1 to Fn and K3 are employed in accordance with the guidance in subclause 6.3.10. • The software (SRASW) is programmed in accordance with the requirements for PL b (reduction of the requirements in the test channel owing to diversity) and the guidance in subclause 6.3.10. • The start button S2 must be located outside the hazard zone and at a point from which the hazard zone is visible. • The number, arrangement and height of the light beams must comply with EN ISO 13855 and IEC 62046. • Should an arrangement for the safeguarding of hazard zones permit stepping behind the sensing field, further measures are required, such as a restart interlock. The start button S2 can be used for this purpose. To this end, the PLC K3 compares the duration for which the button is pressed with maximum and minimum values. Only if the conditions are met is a start command deemed valid. Remarks • The example is intended for use in applications with an infrequent demand of the safety function. This enables the requirement for the designated architecture for Category 2 to be satisfied, i.e. “testing much more frequent than the demand of the safety function” (cf. Annex G). • Following triggering of a stop, the light barriers remain deactivated until the next start. This enables a hazard zone for example to be entered without this being “registered” by the circuit.
