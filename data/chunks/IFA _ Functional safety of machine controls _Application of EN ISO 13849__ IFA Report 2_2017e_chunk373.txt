The T presented by the “D” suffix. Alternative methods can be parameter describes the characteristic life at which 63.2% used to determine the Weibull parameters, depending of the components under consideration have failed. upon the test method. Such methods are also appropriate 271 Annex D when data are incomplete, for example when intact parts five out of seven valves must fail for evaluation of the test are to be considered. Results in the form of data for the results. The “maximum likelihood” and “rank regression” parameters b and T can be read off from the diagrams. In methods are stated in ISO 19973-1 as example methods turn, the nominal life T , at which 10% of the components for determining the Weibull parameters. 10 studied have failed, can then be determined. The durabi- lities of pneumatic and electromechanical components As an approximation, where testing is performed on a are generally stated in the pseudo-unit of (operation) small number of test specimens, e.g. seven valves, the “cycles” rather than in the dimension of time. The mean first failure determines the B value, i.e. the number of 10 number of operations per year n (in cycles per year, see cycles attained by the time of the first failure corresponds op subclause D.2.4.2) is used for conversion. The B value approximately to the B value. Should the first failure be 10 10 in cycles corresponds here to the time-based T
