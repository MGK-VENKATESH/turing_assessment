taking the measured distance and the location of the object, the laser scanner determines the exact position of the object. Pressure Sensitive Safety Mats These devices are used to provide guarding of a fl oor area around a machine. A matrix of interconnected mats is laid around the hazard area and pressure applied to the mat (e.g., an operator’s footstep) will cause the mat controller unit to switch off power to the hazard. Pressure sensitive mats are often used within an enclosed area containing several machines, fl exible manufacturing systems or robotics cells. When cell access is required (for setting or robot “teaching,” for example), they prevent dangerous motion if the operator strays from the safe area. It is important to prevent any movement of the mat(s) by correct and secure fi xing. Pressure Sensitive Edges These devices are fl exible edging strips that can be mounted to the edge of a moving part, such as a machine table or powered door that poses a risk of a crushing or shearing. If the moving part strikes the operator (or vice versa), the fl exible sensitive edge is depressed and will initiate a command to switch off the hazard power source. Sensitive edges can also be used to guard machinery where there is a risk of operator entanglement. If an operator becomes caught in the machine, contact with the sensitive edge will shut down machine power. Light curtains, scanners, fl oor mats and sensitive edges are also classifi ed as “trip devices.” They do not actually restrict access but only “sense” it. They rely entirely on their ability to both sense and switch for the provision of safety. In general they are only suitable on machinery which stops reasonably quickly after switching off the power source. Because an operator can walk
