B value of 10D 100,000 switching cycles [S] is substituted for each contact of an emergency-stop device. The probability of failure of the safety module K1 is added at the end of the calculation (2.3 · 10-9 per hour [M], suitable for PL e). • MTTF : for the contactor relays K2 and K3, the B value corresponds under inductive load (AC 3) to an electrical D 10 durability of 1,000,000 switching cycles [M]. On the assumption that 50% of failures are dangerous, the B value 10D is produced by doubling of the B value. With twelve demands upon the emergency stop function and 24 start 10 commands per year, n is 36 cycles per year and the MTTF is 55,556 years. This is also the symmetrized MTTF for op D D the channel, which is capped to 100 years (“high”). • DC : the DC for K2 and K3 and for S1.1 and S1.2 is 90%. The DC is based upon testing and the detection of cross- avg circuits by the safety module K1. This is also the DC (“medium”). An adequate test rate of the emergency-stop avg devices is assured (refer to the information in subclauses 6.2.14 and D.2.5.1). • Adequate measures against common cause failure (70 points): separation (15), well-tried components (5), over- voltage protection etc. (15) and environmental conditions (25 + 10) • At twelve demands upon the emergency stop function per year, the average probability of dangerous failure PFH D for the emergency stop device S1 is 4.3 · 10-8 per hour. • The subsystem K2/K3 satisfies Category 3 with a high MTTF (100 years) and medium DC (90%). This results in an D avg average probability of dangerous failure of 4.3 · 10-8 per hour. Following addition of the subsystem K1, the average probability
