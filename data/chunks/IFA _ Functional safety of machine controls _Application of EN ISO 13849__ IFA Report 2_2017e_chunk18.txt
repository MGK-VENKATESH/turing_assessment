The original abbreviation (PFH) was however retained (without the “D” suffix in IEC 61508). 15 3 Generic standards concerning the functional safety of machinery control systems Probability of a dangerous failure per hour (PFH ) D 10-4 10-5 10-6 10-7 10-8 3 · 10-6 EN ISO 13849-1 PL a b c d e Figure 3.2: The Performance SIL No 1 2 3 (4) correspondence Level (PL) and IEC 62061 Safety Integrity (IEC
