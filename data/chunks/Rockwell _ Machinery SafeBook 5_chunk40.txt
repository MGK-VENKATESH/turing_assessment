B11.19, Table 3 in CSA Z432, and AS4024.1 provide guidance on the appropriate distance a specifi c opening must be from the hazard. Detecting Access Protective measures can be used to detect access to a hazard. When detection is selected as the method of risk reduction, the designer must understand that a complete safety system must be used; the safeguarding device, by itself, does not provide necessary risk reduction. This safety system generally consists of three blocks: 1) an input device that senses the access to the hazard, 2) a logic device that process the signals from the sensing device, checks the status of the safety system and turns on or off output devices, and 3) an output device that controls the actuator (for example, a motor). 34 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Implementation of Protective Measures Detection Devices Many alternative devices are available to detect the presence of a person entering or inside a hazard area. The best choice for a particular application is dependent on a number of factors. • Environmental factors that might impact the detector reliability • Frequency of access, • Stopping time of hazard, • Importance of completing the machine cycle, and • Containment of projectiles, fl uids, mists, vapours, etc. Appropriately selected movable guards can be interlocked to provide protection against projectiles, fl uids, mists and other types of hazards, and are often used when access to the hazard is infrequent. Interlocked guards can also be locked to prevent access until the machine has had time to reach a complete stop or when stopping the machine in the middle of the cycle is undesirable. Presence sensing devices, like light curtains, mats and laser scanners, provide quick and easy access to the hazard area and are often selected when operators must frequently access the hazard area.
