their correct usage. In particular, attention should be drawn to the possibility of injury if actuated with a key inserted. Area of operation of the emergency stop function The area of operation of the emergency stop function must always include the complete machine. If this creates additional hazards or has an unnecessary impact on production, the machine can be divided into several areas of operation of the emergency stop function. Areas of operation may include parts of a machine, a single machine, or a group of machines. Different areas of operation may overlap. A division into areas of operation should take into account the following: a) the visible areas resulting from the machine design b) the ability to recognize dangerous situations (visibility, audibility, etc.) c) all safety-relevant consequences for other parts of the machine or other machines d) the foreseeable hazard exposures e) all possible hazards in the area of operation The different areas of operation must be defined and marked so that the emergency stop control switches can be easily associated with the appropriate areas. The actuation of an emergency stop device for one area of operation must not prevent the triggering of an emergency stop function in another area of operation. The 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 91 Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION operating instructions of the machine must contain information on the area(s) of operation of the emergency stop control switches. Emergency stop control switches with different areas of operation should, as far as technically possible, not be arranged next to each other or located close to each other. Position of emergency stop control switches Emergency stop control switches must be provided at each operator panel unless the risk assessment indi‐ cates that it is not
