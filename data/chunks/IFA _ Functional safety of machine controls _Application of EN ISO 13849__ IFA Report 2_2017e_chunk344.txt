The pragmatic approach, implemented impairing the function of such a complex component, the in Figure B.3, for estimation of the DC value for the sol- component-related DC must be estimated in considera- der joints and printed circuit board consists in assigning tion both of the dangerous failure mode and of the availa- the average DC value to them that is produced for all ble test method. Support in this assessment is provided other components of the function block from the formula by Table E.2, in which DC values of 0% (“none”), 60% DC = Σ λ /Σ λ . The inclusion of the printed circuit board DD D (“low”), 90% (“medium”) and 99% (“high”) are assigned and solder joints thus has no influence upon the DC value for standard test methods. During assignment of a DC to a calculated for the complete function block. component, it must also be considered that an evaluation result of “detectable” is permissible only if the system is In each row of the table, i.e. for each component: actually capable of performing the intended safety-orien- ted operation. Detection of a failure within a circuit, for λ = temperature factor · base failure rate (if applicable example, is useless if it is rendered ineffective owing to a with further correction factors, see above) shut-off path that has already failed. λ = proportion of safe failures ⋅ λ S In the example shown, the components R1, R6 to R9 and P1 do not need to be considered with regard to the aspect λ = proportion of dangerous failures ⋅ λ D of diagnostics, since they are not capable of causing dan- gerous-mode failure of the “light barrier” function block. λ = DC ⋅ λ DD D The dangerous-mode failure portion of each of
