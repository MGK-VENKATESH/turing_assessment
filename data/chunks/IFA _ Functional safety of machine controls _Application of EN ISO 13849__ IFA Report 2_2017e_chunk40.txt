energy dissipation function Opening of a hydraulic valve for pressure release Control modes and operating mode selection Activation of safety functions by an operating mode selector switch Function for stopping in an emergency Response to actuation of an emergency-stop device with STO or SS1 (Table 5.2) 29 5 Safety functions and their contribution to risk reduction Table 5.2: Safety functions described in IEC 61800-5-2 (2016 edition) [20] Abbreviation Description Function STO Safe torque off Motor not receiving energy capable of generating rotary movement; stop category 0 to EN 60204-1 SS1-r Safe stop 1 Motor decelerating; monitoring of deceleration ramp and STO following SS1-t standstill (SS1-r), or STO following a timeout (SS1-t); stop category 1 to EN 60204-1 SS2-r Safe stop 2 Motor decelerating; monitoring of deceleration ramp and SOS following SS2-t standstill (SS2-r), or SOS following a timeout (SS2-t); stop category 2 to EN 60204-1 SOS Safe operating stop Motor is stationary and resisting external forces SLA Safely-limited acceleration Violation of an acceleration and/or deceleration limit value is prevented. SLS Safely-limited speed Exceeding of the speed limit value is prevented. SLT Safely-limited torque Violation of a torque/force limit value is prevented. SLP Safely-limited position Exceeding of a position limit value is prevented. SLI Safely-limited increment The motor is moved a specified incremental distance, after which it stops. SDI Safe direction The motor is prevented from running in the undesired direction. SMT Safe motor temperature Exceeding of a motor temperature limit value is prevented. SBC Safe brake control Safe actuation of an external brake. SCA Safe cam A safe output signal is generated as long as the motor position remains within a specified range. SSM Safe speed monitor A safe output signal is generated as long as the motor speed remains below a specified value. SAR Safe acceleration range The acceleration
