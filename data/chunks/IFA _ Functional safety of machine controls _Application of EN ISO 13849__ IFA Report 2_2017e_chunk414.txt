Firstly, the (BGIA Report 2/2008e): standard limits the number of designated architectures and therefore also the number of necessary models. • Reference to Note 1 in Annex K of the new standard Secondly, the large number of input parameters has been reduced by intelligent grouping. For this purpose, the • Explanations from subclause 4.5.4 of the standard of values MTTF and DC were introduced, each of which D avg the time aspects during testing brought into line with groups several input parameters. the new standard The MTTF used in the diagram represents a mean time to D • Explanations inserted concerning extension of the failure of each channel in its dangerous failure mode.

Conversely, the DC represents the weighted avg Unlike its predecessor, EN 954-1 [1], EN ISO 13849-1 makes average value of the diagnostic coverage for the entire provision for demonstration of a Performance Level (PL) in system; this value is used for assignment to one of the addition to examination of the Category.
