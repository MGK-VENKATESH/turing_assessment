For this purpose, the drive/actuator elements are switched off by power control elements. NOTE - Principle of switch off/power shutdown: ISO 13849-2 (type-B standard) Contactors Electromechanical contactors are the most commonly used type of power control element. One or more contactors can form a safety function subsystem by combining special selection criteria, wiring, and technical measures. By protecting the contacts against overcurrent and short-circuits, over-sizing (normally by a factor of 2) and other measures, a contactor is considered a proven component. To be able to perform diagnostics on contactors for safety functions, unambiguous feedback of the output state is necessary (EDM = external device monitoring). This requirement can be met using a contactor with positively guided contacts. The contacts are positively guided when the contacts in a set of contacts are mechanically linked in such a way that normally open contacts and normally closed contacts can never be closed simultaneously during at any point during the intended mission time. 118 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice The term “positively guided contacts” refers primarily Normally closed to auxiliary contactors and auxiliary contacts. A defined contact ≥0.5 mm distance between the contacts of at least 0.5 mm at the normally closed
