B1 D K1 D Q1 D Q2 D Q3 = 4,5·10-9 + 2·10-9 + 5.79·10-8 + 8·10-8 + 2·10-7 = 3.44·10-7 PL d In this case, the safety function would therefore have not achieved a total PL e, which was required for the risks associated with the robot and hydraulic press. Conclusions • Use the practical approach. • Use safety devices/logic units with high reliability (low PFH ) to make it easy to achieve the PL required. D r • With Vital or Pluto, it is easier to achieve the PL required. r Safety in control systems according to EN ISO 13849-1 | 15 SISTEMA A tool for determining performance level (PL) and generating technical documentation EN ISO 13849-1 requires calculations. To do this in a To work with SISTEMA in a rational way, we have developed manageable way a software tool provides excellent help. a library of our products for download from our website ABB Jokab Safety has chosen to use SISTEMA, a software www.jokabsafety.se. In order to have access to the latest tool developed by BGIA, now called IFA, in Germany. The tool version, visit this page periodically to check for updates and is freeware and can be downloaded from the IFA website, new releases. www.dguv.de/ifa. With SISTEMA it is possible to “build” To download SISTEMA go to www.dguv.de/ifa/en/pra/ safety functions, verify them and generate the technical softwa/sistema/index.jsp or search the Internet for “sistema”. documentation required.
