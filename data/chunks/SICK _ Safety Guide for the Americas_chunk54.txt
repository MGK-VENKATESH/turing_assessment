Subsystems Every fluid-related system comprises the following subsystems: Design principles 1 • Compressing: compressor/pump All parts of a fluid-related system are to be protected against • Conditioning: filters pressures that exceed the maximum operating pressure of a • Pumping: pipework/hoses subsystem or the rated pressure of a component. A hazard • Controlling: valve shall not be caused by leaks in a component or in the pipe- • Driving: cylinder work/hoses. Acoustic attenuators are to be used to reduce the Pressure is established in any fluid-related system by pumping noise caused by escaping air.
