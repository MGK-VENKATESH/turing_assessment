156 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS B2 Q1 K2 B1 T1 Safety functions • Safety-related stop function, initiated by a guard: opening of the moveable guard initiates the safety function STO (safe torque off): Guard 1 with type 1 position switches (loading) Guard 2 with type 2 position switch (unloading) • Emergency stop function, STO – safe torque off by actuation of the emergency stop device Functional description • Actuation of the emergency stop device S1 possessing two direct opening contacts causes hazardous movements or states to be de-energized redundantly via the safety module K1, by interruption of the control voltage of the con- tactor Q1 and selection of the controller inhibit of the frequency inverter T1. • In addition, a hazard zone is guarded by two moveable guards (e.g. one each for loading and unloading). Opening of guard 1 is detected by two position switches B1/B2 employing a break contact/make contact combination, and evaluated in a central safety module K2. The latter can interrupt or prevent hazardous movements or states in the same way as K1. Guard 2 is monitored by a type 2 position switch with the contacts B3.1 and B3.2 and a safety module K3, also acting upon Q1 and T1. • The safety function is retained in the event of a component failure. • The majority of component failures are detected and lead to operating inhibition. The position switches B1 and B2 on guard 1 are monitored for plausibility in the associated safety module. The safety module also employs internal diagnostics measures. • The electrical contacts B3.1 and B3.2 are monitored for plausibility in the associated safety module K3. This also employs internal diagnostics measures. • Faults in the contactor Q1 are detected by means of mirror contacts and their readback in K2 and K3. Additional
