parts of the control system. • MTTF of the functional channel of the logic and hydraulic control system: in accordance with SN 29500-2, an MTTF D D of 878 years [D] is considered for the microcontroller K3, including its peripherals. The following values are substi- tuted for the further electrical components [D]: 45,662 years for the switching transistors K5 and K7, 228,311 years for the resistances R1 and R2, and 1,142 years for the measuring amplifiers K6 and K8. An MTTF of 150 years [S] is D assumed for the proportional valve 1V4. The MTTF value of the functional channel is thus 104 years. D • MTTF of the test channel of the logic and hydraulic control: in accordance with SN 29500-2, an MTTF of 878 years D D [D] is considered for the microcontroller K4, including its peripherals. An MTTF of 75 years [E] is assumed for the D position measuring system 1S4. An MTTF of 150 years [S] is assumed for the directional control valve 1V3. The D MTTF value of the test channel is thus 47 years. Use of the simplified procedure described in the standard for esti- D mation of the quantifiable aspects of the PL is conditional upon the MTTF of the test channel being greater than D half the MTTF of the functional channel. The MTTF value of the functional channel is therefore reduced to 94 years. D D • DC of the functional channel of the logic and hydraulic control: the DC for K3 is 60% owing to cross monitoring avg with K4 and self-tests of simple effectiveness by means of software; the DC for the remaining electrical compo- nents is 90% owing to fault detection in K4 by means of the position measuring system 1S4. The DC for 1V4 is 99% owing
