• Logic consideration of the drives critical to the operator‘s safety. The associated functional diagram is shown in Figure 5.6. • Drive If more than one drive is involved in the hazardous Figure 5.7 shows the functional diagram and blocks of the movements in the danger zone under consideration, the safety function SF3. hazards are considered overlapping. If the number of drives to be considered is too high, the sum of the PFH Figure 5.7: D values of the individual drives may once again be a total Stopping of the drive when guard door 3 is opened PFH that is too high for the required PL of the safety D function. The revised standard makes provision for consi- Positioning monitoring deration of overlapping hazards. Accordingly, the hazards of guard door 1 considered in the safety function in question can under certain circumstances be reduced to discrete hazards, i.e. Positioning monitoring the hazardous machine movements can be reduced to the of guard door 2 movements of discrete parts of the machine. Whether this is possible in a given case must be determined during the Positioning monitoring Logic Drive risk assessment.
