its own right. The authors have also added notes on safety functions for maintenance and servicing tasks. The familiar tables with references to international standards for typical safety functions in machinery and some of their characteristics have now been moved from section 5 to a new informative Annex M. A new subsection 5.2.3 requires designers to minimise any motivation to defeat safety functions. Practical feasibility during machine use must be considered at an early stage, when defining a safety function. Another new subsection, 5.2.4, specifies that, by default, remote access must be limited in such a way that no dangerous situations can arise through the unnoticed presence of persons within the hazard zone of the machinery. Fourth Edition of EN ISO 13849-1 (July 2023) 4 / 12 The next steps, which complete the specification phase, are the determination of the PL and the r review of the safety requirements specification (SRS). This review must be carried out before entering the SRP/CS desgn phase, so that any specification errors can be rectified at an early stage. The final subsection, 5.5, is about the decomposition of SRP/CS into subsystems. At this point, we can see that the standard in its fourth edition makes a clear distinction between SRP/CS and subsystems. SRP/CS describes the safety-related part of a control system that carries out an entire safety function â€“ from the triggering event to the reaction required to either achieve or maintain a safe state. Along the hardware chain from the input (sensors) through the logic (processing) to the output (power control elements), the SRP/CS can be decomposed into subsystems, each carrying out a (safety) sub-function. The number of participating subsystems, however, may vary. As explained in the previous section, any subsystems that have previously been validated can be integrated, and subsystems can be
