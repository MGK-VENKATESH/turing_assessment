are substituted for B1 and B2: B : 100,000 cycles [E]; 10D n : 10 cycles per year. For the contactor relays K19 to K21: B : 400,000 cycles [S]; n : 10 cycles per day on op 10D op 365 working days. An MTTF of 1,141 years [D] is substituted for the microcontroller K1. The following MTTF values D D are sub stituted for the electronic components [D]: 4,566 years for the watchdog K8, 5,707 years for the optocoup- lers K9 to K18, 22,831 years for the logic gates K2 to K6, 38,052 years for the voltage monitor K7, 45,662 years for transistors and 228,310 years for resistors. An MTTF of 228 years [E] is assumed for the power supply K22. Summa- D tion of the failure rates for all components of the functional channel (blocks I, L and O) produces an MTTF value of D 128 years. This value is capped to 100 years (“high”) in accordance with the requirements of the standard. • The MTTF of the test channel is produced by summation of the failure rates of all components of blocks TE and D OTE. The resulting value of 389 years is greater than or equal to half of the MTTF of the functional channel. D • DC : the DC is 60% for B1, K10 and K6 owing to cross monitoring of B1 and B2 in K1 with a low demand rate upon avg the safety function. The DC is 60% for K1 owing to temporal monitoring of program sequence and self-tests of sim- ple effectiveness. The DC is 99% for K2, K3, K16, K17, K19 and K20 owing to direct monitoring by means of mecha- nically linked contact elements. For K22, the DC is 99%. The averaging formula returns a result of 93% (“medium”)
