for machinery Output Devices Safety Control Relays and Safety Contactors Control Relays and Contactors are used to remove electrical power from the actuator. Special features are added to control relays and contactors to enable their use for safety. Mechanically linked auxiliary contacts are used to feed back the status of the control relays and contactors to a monitoring logic device. The use of mechanically linked contacts helps ensure the safety function. To meet the requirements of mechanically linked contacts, the normally closed and the normally open contacts cannot be in the closed state at the same time. IEC 60947-4-1 defi nes the requirements for mechanically linked contacts. If the normally open contacts were to weld, the normally closed contacts remain open by at least 0.5mm. Conversely, if the normally closed contacts were to weld, then the normally open contacts remain open. Safety systems must only be started at specifi c locations. Standard rated control relays and contactors allow the armature to be depressed to close the normally open contacts. On safety rated devices, the armature is protected from manual override to mitigate unexpected startup. On safety control relays, the normally closed contact is driven by the main spanner. Safety contactors use an adder deck to locate the mechanically linked contacts. If the contact block were to fall off the base, the mechanically linked contacts remain closed. The mechanically linked contacts are permanently affi xed to the safety control relay or safety contactor. On the larger contactors, an adder deck is insuffi cient to accurately refl ect the status of the wider spanner. Mirrored contacts are used and are located on either side of the contactor. Dropout time of control relays or contactors play a role in the safety distance calculation. Often, a surge suppressor is placed across the coil to
