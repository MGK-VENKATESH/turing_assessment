Figure 2 of the standard shows, as did Figure 1, that the application of EN ISO 13849-1 must be regarded as stage 2 of the risk reduction process, i.e. as risk reduction through technical protective measures. This is followed by a brief overview of the subsequent sections of the standard, based on the typical workflow of a design process for SRP/CS: The specification of safety functions (including their PL) is followed by the technical realisation and r specification of PLs, including their validation and documentation. This section finishes with an overview of the basic options for realising a safety function: • integration of subsystems that have previously been validated under a functional safety standard for machine control systems, • proprietary design of a new subsystem based on EN ISO 13849 itself or • combination of subsystems of both of the above options. All requirements on the design of subsystems, including hardware and software, have been moved to section 6 and subsequent sections, as safety functions need to be defined first in the development process. 5 Section 5: Specification of safety functions and Annex M Safety functions now need to be defined in detail as part of a safety requirements specification (SRS) The definition of each safety function continues to be based on the risk assessment and reduction process as per EN ISO 12100. The required details for a precise and complete definition of each safety function include the following items: Fourth Edition of EN ISO 13849-1 (July 2023) 3 / 12 • brief description or title (as a unique reference), • triggering event that demands the safety function, • required reaction that must be initiated by the safety function in order to achieve the intended safe state, • required performance level PL, r • permitted response time, i.e. the time
