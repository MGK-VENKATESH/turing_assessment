On the other hand, • Direction of movement of the material (sequence of the mut- where protective devices preventing access (protective devices ing signals) that cannot be trespassed) are concerned, muting shall only be • Limiting of the muting duration possible if no dangerous machine functions are present (see • Material request by the machine control 3 figure). This status is determined by muting sensors or signals. • Operational status of the material handling elements (e.g., For the muting function, great care is necessary when selecting conveyor belt, roller conveyor) c and positioning the muting sensors and controller signals used. • Material identification by additional properties (e.g., bar code) - Practical application of ESPE: IEC TS 62046, ANSI B11.19, RIA TR R15.406, CSA Z432, NR-12 Muting function with safety light curtain and muting sensors on a wrapping machine. 7028282/2014-09-08 GUIDE FOR SAFE MACHINERY | SICK 3-35 Subject to change without notice Safeguarding (technical protective measures) Risk reduction Safety light curtains with entry/exit function Safety laser scanners with protective field switching Active differentiation between person and machine (entry/exit Active switching of protective fields provides other way of mov- function) provides other way of moving material into a safe- ing material into a safeguarded area.
