For this reason only the logic unit and the power control elements are described below. Errors and failures in drive/actuator elements are normally excluded. Fluid control systems are often implemented as electropneumatic or electrohydraulic control systems. In other words, the electrical signals are converted to fluid energy by valves to move cylinders and other power control elements. 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 113 Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION Logic units In a logic unit, different input signals are linked to output signals. Electromechanical, electronic, or programmable electronic components are often used for this purpose. NOTICE Depending on the required reliability, the signals from the protective devices shall not be processed only by standard control systems. There must, if necessary, also be parallel cut-off paths. Logic unit: basic construction with auxiliary contactors +24 V Main circuit +24 V +24 V Res.
