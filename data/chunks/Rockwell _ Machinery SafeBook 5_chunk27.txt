need additional considerations to one that is used in an industrial tool room. It is also possible that individual safe machines may be combined together in a manner that could be unsafe. It should also be remembered that if a user company acquires two or more independent machines and integrates them into one process they are the manufacturer of the resulting combined machine. So now let us consider the essential steps on the route to a proper safety strategy. The following can be applied to an existing factory installation or a single new machine. 23 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery Risk Assessment It is wrong to regard risk assessment as a burden. It is a helpful process that provides vital information and empowers the user or designer to take logical decisions about ways of achieving safety. There are various standards that cover this subject. (EN) ISO 12100 Safety of machinery — General principles for design — Risk assessment and risk reduction contains the most globally applied guidance. An ISO Technical Report: ISO/TR 14121-2 is also available. It gives practical guidance and examples of methods for risk assessment. Whichever technique is used to carry out a risk assessment, a cross functional team of people will usually produce a result with wider coverage and better balance than one individual. Risk assessment is an iterative process; it will be performed at different stages of the machine life cycle. The information available will vary according to the stage of the life cycle. For example, a risk assessment conducted by a machine builder will have access to every detail of the machine mechanisms and construction materials but probably only an approximate assumption of the machine’s ultimate working environment. A risk assessment conducted by the machine user would not necessarily have access
