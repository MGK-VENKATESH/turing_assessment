The protective conductor connected to the electrically conductive equipment housing is not connected to this star point, but is earthed separately. The chassis of the equipment can also be earthed using a common protective earth electrode. TT systems are usually only used in connection with residual current circuit breakers. The advantage of the TT system lies in its increased reliability for remote areas. IT system The conductive housings of the equipment in an IT system are earthed in the same way as in a TT system, but the star point of the feeding transformer is not. Systems in which a shutdown will result in a hazardous situation and which should therefore not be shut down yet in the event of a single short-circuit or earth fault are designed as IT systems. In the low-voltage area, IT systems are required, for example, to supply operating rooms and intensive care stations in hospitals. 32 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 2 SAFE DESIGN (INHERENTLY SAFE DESIGN) NOTE - Protective measures: Basic standard IEC 61140 and IEC 60364-4-41 with varying national amendments. Mains disconnection device According to IEC 60204-1, a mains disconnection device must be provided for every power supply connection to one or more machines. It must be able to isolate the electrical equipment from the power supply. The following disconnection devices can be used for this purpose: • Power circuit breaker for use category AC-23B or DC-23B • Isolating switch with auxiliary contact for leading load shedding • Circuit breaker • Plug/socket combination up to 16 A / 3 kW Certain circuits such as control circuits for interlocking functions do not need to be shut down by the isolation device. In this case special precautions must be taken to ensure the safety
