CEN prepares the European Standards (EN) in non-electrical areas. To prevent these standards representing barri‐ ers to trade, CEN collaborates with ISO. Using a voting procedure, CEN determines whether ISO standards are adopted and publishes them as European standards. CENELEC (Comité Européen de Normalisation Electrotechnique/European Commit‐ tee for Electrotechnical Standardization) CENELEC is the comparable institution to CEN in the area of electrical technology, and prepares and publishes European standards (EN) in this area. CENELEC is increas‐ ingly adopting IEC standards and their numbering system. 18 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice § – LAWS, DIRECTIVES, STANDARDS National standardization organizations and structures As a rule each EU member state has its own standardization organization, e.g., DIN, ON, BSI, AFNOR.
