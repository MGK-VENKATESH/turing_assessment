faults on the unmonitored valves become apparent in the work process. The valves 2V2 and 2V3 should be equipped with posi- tion monitors, or – since this is not yet state of the art – they should be checked regularly for correct operation. An accumulation of undetected faults can lead to loss of the safety function. • Should trapped compressed air pose a further hazard, additional measures are required. Design features • Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. • The directional control valve 1V1 features a closed centre position with sufficient overlap and spring-centred central position. • The stop valves 2V2 and 2V3 are ideally screwed into the cylinder and driven by the valve 2V1 acting as a pilot valve. • The safety-oriented switching position is assumed from any position by cancellation of the control signal. • A single-channel PLC for example is employed for the processing of signals from the pressure monitor 2S1. Calculation of the probability of failure • MTTF : B values of 20,000,000 cycles [S] are assumed for the valves 1V1, 2V1, 2V2 and 2V3. At 240 working days, D 10D 16 working hours and a cycle time of 20 seconds, n is 691,200 cycles per year. The MTTF for 1V1, 2V1, 2V2 and 2V3 op D is thus 289 years. Capping of the two channels to 100 years results in a symmetrized MTTF value per channel of D 98 years (“high”). • DC : pressure monitoring of the control signal for the stop valves results in a DC of 99% for 2V1. Fault detection via avg the process results in a DC of 60% for 1V1, and regular checking of operation in a DC of 60% for 2V2/2V3. Averaging thus produces a DC of 69.8% (“low”).
