travel- ing speed is generally used to determine the minimum distance and not the approach speed of people. When the vehicle (and therefore the protective device) and a person are approaching each other, under normal circumstances it is assumed the per- son will recognize the danger and stop or move away. Therefore, the minimum distance only needs to be set to a length that is sufficient to stop the vehicle safely. Safety supplements may be necessary dependent on the ap- plication and the technology used.
