5.10: Paper cutting guillotine with two-hand control (THC) and electro-sensitive protective equipment (ESPE) the stack in order to hold it in place during cutting. The The following operating modes are implemented: knife and the clamping bar are driven hydraulically. 1. Pressing 5.7.1 Definition of the limits of the machine 2. Manual cutting (single cut) 3. Automatic sequence of cuts (automatic process Space limits following the first, manual cut) 4. Knife change Since paper-cutting guillotines are charged manually, sufficient space is required for the handling of product In the first three operating modes, movement of the clam- for cutting, onward transport and storage of the cut paper ping bar alone is possible, in order for the line of cut to stack, and disposal of paper waste, as well as sufficient be indicated. For this purpose, the operator operates a space for the operator to move. pedal, and is able at the same time to alter the position of the paper stack with his or her hands within the danger Time limits zone. Depending upon the application, the machine may be 5.7.2 Identification of the hazards used for a period of approximately 20 years. Component wear may lengthen the time required for a movement to The following mechanical hazards are significant for a stop. The resulting violation of the overrun must therefore paper-cutting guillotine: be detected and must result in the machine being stop- ped. • G1 – crushing by the clamping bar • G2 – cutting by the knife during the cutting process Use limits • G3 – cutting by the knife in the rest position The intended use of the machine is that of cutting stacked Risk estimation sheets of paper or similar materials. The machine is charged manually by a single person. Depending upon The dynamic press force of
