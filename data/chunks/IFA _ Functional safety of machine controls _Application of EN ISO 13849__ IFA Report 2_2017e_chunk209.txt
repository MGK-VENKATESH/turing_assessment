measures for fault detection are implemented. Design features • Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. Protective circuits (such as contact protection) as described in the initial paragraphs of Chapter 8 are implemented. The closed-circuit current principle is employed as a basic safety principle. The control circuit is also earthed, as a well-tried safety principle • The emergency stop device S1 is a switch with positive mode of actuation in accordance with IEC 60947-5-5, and is therefore a well-tried component in accordance with Table D.3 of EN ISO 13849-2. • The signal is processed by a contactor (stop Category 0 to IEC 60204-1). • Contactor Q1 is a well-tried component provided the additional conditions in accordance with Table D.3 of EN ISO 13849-2 are observed. Remarks • The function for stopping in an emergency is a protective measure that complements the safety functions for the safeguarding of hazard zones. 118 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS S1 Q1 Calculation of the probability of failure • MTTF : S1 is a standard emergency stop device according to EN ISO 13850. It is manufactured in accordance with D IEC 60947-5-5. In accordance with EN ISO 13849-1, Table C.1, a B value of 100,000 switching cycles may be 10D applied in this case for emergency stop devices, irrespective of the load [S]. For the contactor Q1, the B value cor- 10 responds under inductive load (AC 3) to an electrical durability of 1,300,000 switching cycles [M]. On the assump- tion that 50% of failures are dangerous, the B value is produced by doubling of the B value. If the start/stop 10D 10 facility is assumed to be actuated twice a day on 365 working days and the emergency stop device to be actuated twelve times a
