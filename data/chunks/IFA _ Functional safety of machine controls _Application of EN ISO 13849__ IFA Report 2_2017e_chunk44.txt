The worst case should therefore be considered representative for all conceivable A required Performance Level PL – in technical terms, the r situations. The worst case is determined by the worst desired value – must be specified for each implemented PFH , and is therefore partly dependent upon the num- safety function3. The requirements are derived from the D ber of drives in the safety chain that generate hazardous necessary risk reduction. During definition of the risk movements at the least favourable location, and upon the reduction, consideration must also be given to the likeli- respective individual PFH values.
