safety system must undergo testing to meet Category 2. The tests must be designed to detect faults within the safety related parts of the control system. If no faults are detected, the machine is allowed to run. If faults are detected a fault reaction function must ensure that the machine remains in a safe state. Wiring Wiring Input Logic Output Functional test Test Test Output The equipment performing the test can be an integral part of the safety system or a separate piece of equipment. 99 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery The testing must be performed: • when the machine is initially powered, • prior to the initiation of a hazard, and. • periodically if deemed necessary by the risk assessment Note: (EN) ISO 138491-1 assumes a test to safety function demand ratio of 100:1 or a test at the demand of the safety function with the capability to detect a fault and stop the machine in a shorter time than it takes to reach the hazard. In essence a safety system or subsystem must be exercised in order to test if its safety function is still working correctly. This means it can be diffi cult or impossible to implement with technologies that have mechanical characteristics. A Category 2 approach is usually more relevant to electronic technology. For PLd there must be a test output capable of initiating a safe state in the event of the detection of a fault. Category 3 In addition to meeting the requirements of Category B and well-tried safety principles, Category 3 requires successful performance of the safety function in the presence of a single fault. The fault must be detected at or before the next demand on the safety function, whenever reasonably practicable. Some faults, such as cross-faults, which do
