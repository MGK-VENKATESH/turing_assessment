the following measures: • Cutting off the power supply to induce a safe status • Measures to manage the effects of errors and other effects arising out of a shared data communication process, including transmission errors, repeats, loss, insertion, incorrect sequence, corruption, delay, etc. Determining the level of safety for a subsystem as per IEC 62061 IEC 62061 also supports the determination of the safety level of subsystems created by interconnecting individual components. erutcurtS ytilibaileR scitsongaiD ecnatsiseR ssecorP 3D – VERIFYING THE SAFETY FUNCTION SIL Safety integrity level HFT PFH DC/SFF CCF Check D Figure 116: Aspects for determining the safety integrity level of a subsystem The safety integrity level (SIL) achieved for a subsystem is made up of the following parameters: • Hardware fault tolerance (HFT) • PFH value D • Safe failure fraction (SFF) • Common cause failures (CCF) • Software aspects that are relevant to safety • Systematic failures 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 139 Subject to change without notice 3D – VERIFYING THE SAFETY FUNCTION Hardware fault tolerance (HFT) IEC 62061 defines the structure based on subsystem types and hardware fault tolerance (HFT). HFT 0 means that a single failure in the hardware can result in the loss of the safety function (single-channel systems). HFT 1 means that despite a single failure in the hardware, protection is maintained (dual-channel systems).

For each subsystem, a formula exists to describe the mathematical model to calculate the PFH value. The following parameters
