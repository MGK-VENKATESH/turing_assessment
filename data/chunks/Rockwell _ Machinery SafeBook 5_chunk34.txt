unexpected power up is to remove the energy from the system and to lock the system in the off state. The purpose is to allow people to safely enter a machineâ€™s hazard zones. Lockout / Tagout New machines must be built with lockable energy isolating devices. The devices apply to all types of energy, including electrical, hydraulic, pneumatic, gravity, and lasers. Lockout refers to applying a lock to an energy isolating device. The lock must only be removed by its owner or by a supervisor under controlled conditions. When multiple individuals must work on the machine, each individual must apply their locks to the energy isolating devices. Each lock must be identifi able to its owner. In the U.S., tagout is an alternative to lockout for older machines where a lockable device has never been installed. In this case, the machine is turned off and a tag is applied to warn all personnel to not start the machine while the tag holder is working on the machine. Beginning in 1990, machines that are modifi ed must be upgraded to include a lockable energy isolating device. 29 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery An energy isolating device is a mechanical device that physically prevents the transmission or release of energy. These devices can take the form of a circuit breaker, a disconnect switch, a manually operated switch, a plug/socket combination or a manually operated valve. Electrical isolating devices must switch all ungrounded supply conductors and no pole can operate independently. The purpose of lockout and tagout is to prevent the unexpected startup of the machine. Unexpected startup may be the result of various causes: a failure of the control system; an inappropriate action on a start control, sensor, contactor, or valve; a restoration of power after an interruption;
