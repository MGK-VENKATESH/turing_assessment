The functions of “releasing” and “pressing in fully” one position switch exists for monitoring of the locking are grouped below in a single safety function, since the element and for the associated actuating mechanism. direction of actuation is not predictable. • The restrictions stated in the relevant Type C standards for machines must be observed.
