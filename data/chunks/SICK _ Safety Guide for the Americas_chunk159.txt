cases, the PL for this subsystem must be determined separately. The performance level achieved for a subsystem is made up of the following parameters: • Structure and behavior of the safety function under fault conditions (category g 3-83) • MTTFd values of individual components (g3-84) • Diagnostic coverage (DC g 3-85) • Common cause failure (CCF g 3-91) • Software aspects that are relevant to safety • Systematic failures Risk reduction Technical protective measures Category of safety-related parts of control systems (ISO 13849-1) Subsystems are usually single-channel or dual-channel. Unless by introducing additional testing components or dual-channel additional measures are in place, single-channel systems re- systems supporting reciprocal testing. ISO 13849-1 defines spond to faults with a dangerous failure. Faults can be detected categories for classifying the structure of subsystems.
