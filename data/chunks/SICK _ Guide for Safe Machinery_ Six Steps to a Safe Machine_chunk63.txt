DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION Safety switches, position switches and interlocking devices The commonly used term “safety switch” does not appear in the standards because the multitude of technologies and suitable sensor designs for interlocking devices does not allow general requirements to be defined. Regardless of the technology used (mechanical, electrical, pneumatic, hydraulic), the following definitions apply: • An interlocking device consists of an actuator and a position switch. • A position switch consists of an actuator and an output signal element. Depending on the technology of the position switch used and the functional safety requirements, either one or more interlocking devices will be required for a physical guard. Mechanical attachment Reliable mechanical attachment of the position switches and actuators is crucial for their effectiveness. The elements of interlocking devices • shall be fitted such that they are protected against damage due to foreseeable external effects. • shall not be used as a mechanical stop. • shall be secured against unintentional operation and damage by means of their arrangement and design. • shall be secured against unintentional changes in position by their arrangement, design and fastening. secured. If necessary, the switch and the actuating element must be secured by means of positive locking, e.g., with round holes, dowel pins, stops. • shall be protected by their actuation method, or their integration in the control shall be such that they cannot be easily bypassed. • shall be possible to check the switches for correct operation and, if possible, they shall be easily accessible for inspection.
