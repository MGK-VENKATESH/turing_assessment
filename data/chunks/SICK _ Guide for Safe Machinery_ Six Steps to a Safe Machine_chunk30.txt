are excluded by design. Safe design is therefore the most effective approach. Aspects of safe design relate to the machine itself and the interaction between the person at risk and the machine. Examples: • Mechanical design • Operating and maintenance concept • Electrical equipment (electrical safety, EMC) • Strategies for emergency stop in an emergency situation • Equipment involving fluids • Materials and resources used • Machine function and production process All components should be selected, applied and adapted in such a way that the safety of persons is maintained in the event of a machine error. The prevention of harm to the machine and the environment shall also be considered. All elements of the machine shall be designed to operate within the specified limits. The design should be as simple as possible. Safety-related functions shall be separated from other functions as far as possible. Mechanical design The following measures are examples of how mechanical design can prevent the arising of hazards: • Avoiding sharp edges, corners, and protruding parts • Avoiding crushing points, shearing points, and entanglement points • Limiting kinetic energy (mass and speed) • Considering ergonomic principles Correct Incorrect refrödueN :ecruoS Figure 14: Example: Avoiding shearing points The distance e should be ≤ 6 mm!

This can be achieved, for example, by: • Automatic loading and unloading stations • Setup
