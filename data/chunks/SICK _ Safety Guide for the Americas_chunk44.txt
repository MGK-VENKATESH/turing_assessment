an electrically conductive connection to the earth. point via the protective conductor (PE). A differentiation is made between protective earthing (PE), Depending on the wire cross-section laid, PE and N cables are which is related to electrical safety, and functional earthing laid as a common cable (TN-C system) or as two independent (FE), which is used for other purposes. The protective conduc- cables (TN-S system). tor system comprises earth electrodes, connecting cables, and the related terminals. For equipotential bonding, all chassis of TT system electrical equipment on the power supply must be connected In a TT system the supply transformerâ€™s star point is earthed to the protective conductor system. Equipotential bonding is a as in a TN system. The protective conductor connected to the basic means of protection in the event of a fault. electrically conductive equipment housing is not laid to this star point, but is earthed separately. The chassis of the equipment L1 can also be earthed using a common protective earth elec- L2 trode. L3 N TT systems are usually only used in connection with residual PE current circuit breakers. The advantage of the TT system lies in its increased reliability Fuse for remote areas. IT system The conductive equipment housings are earthed in an IT sys- tem as in a TT system, but the supply transformers star point Wire marking is not earthed in the same way. Systems on which shutdown Protective conductor involves a certain degree of danger which, therefore, are not connection to be shut down on the occurrence of only a fault to chassis or Housing earth are designed as IT systems. Equipotential bonding IT systems are stipulated in the low voltage area (to supply Power supply isolation device power to operating theaters and intensive care stations in hospitals, for example). - Protective
