the reach over criteria applies. Single or Multiple Beams Single or multiple separate beams are further defi ned by the ISO EN standards. The fi gures below shows the “practical” heights of multiple beams above the fl oor. The depth penetration is 850mm for most cases and 1200mm for the single beam usage. In comparison, the US CAN approach takes this into account by the Reach- Through requirements. Getting over, under or around the single and multiple beams must always be taken into consideration. # Beams Height above the fl oor - mm (in) C - mm (in) 1 750 (29.5) 1200 (47.2) 2 400 (5.7), 900 (35.4) 850 (33.4) 3 300 (11.8), 700 (27.5), 1100 (43.3) 850 (33.4) 4 300 (11.8), 600 (23.6), 900 (35.4), 1200 (47.2) 850 (33.4) Distance Calculations For the normal approach to light curtains, the safety distance calculation for the ISO EN and US CAN are close, but differences do exist. For the normal approach to vertical light curtains where the object sensitivity is a maximum of 40mm, the ISO EN approach requires two steps. First, calculate S using 2000 for the speed constant. S = 2000 x T + 8 x (d -1 4) The minimum distance that S can be is 100mm. 58 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety Distance Calculation A second step can be used when the distance is greater than 500mm. Then the value of K can be reduced to 1600. When using K=1600, the minimum value of S is 500mm. The US CAN approach uses a one step approach: Ds = 1600 x T * Dpf This leads to differences greater than 5% between the standards, when the response time is less than 560ms. Angled Approaches Most applications of light curtains and scanners are mounted in vertical (normal approach) or horizontal
