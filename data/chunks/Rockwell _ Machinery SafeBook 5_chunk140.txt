EO_19 in place of EO_18, and K2 in place of K1. 22 Connect the A1 terminal of K1 to the A1 terminal of K2. After approximately 18 seconds, the 440C-CR30 safety relay must trip. The hazardous motion coasts to a stop. The red Fault status indicator LED on the 440C-CR30 safety relay is ON. 23 Disconnect the A1 terminal of K1 from the A1 terminal of K2. Press and release the Reset button on the 440C- CR30 safety relay. The 440C-CR30 safety relay must not respond. 24 Cycle power to the 440C-CR30 safety relay. It responds. The Fault status indicator LED on the 440C-CR30 safety relay is OFF. 25 Press and release the Reset button on the 440C-CR30 safety relay. Press the external Start button. The hazardous motion must resume. Validation of Safe Response to Abnormal Operation – The safety system responds properly to all foreseeable faults with corresponding diagnostics. Contactor Feedback – 440C-CR30 Confi gurable Safety Relay Tests Test Step Verifi cation Pass/Fail Changes/ Modifi cations 1 While the machine continues to run, remove the K1 feedback connection at terminal P1_00. The machine must continue to run. 2 Open the guarded door. The safety system must trip. The hazardous motion must stop within less than 0.7 seconds. Monitor the status indicator LEDs for proper operation, and monitor the 440C-CR30 relay for proper status by using the Connected Components Workbench software. 3 Close the guarded door. The machine must not start. The 440C- CR30 relay must not respond. Monitor the status indicator LEDs for proper operation, and monitor the 440C-CR30 relay for proper status by using the Connected Components Workbench software. 4 Press and release the Reset button on the 440C-CR30 safety relay. The 440C-CR30 relay must not respond. Monitor the status indicator LEDs for proper operation, and monitor the
