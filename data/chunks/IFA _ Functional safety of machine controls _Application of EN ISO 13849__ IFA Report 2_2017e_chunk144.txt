Should descriptive documents (comprehensive specification) either of the actuators of the two-hand control be enables a control Category to be determined and the released during this cycle or a signal change occur actual circuit to be mapped to an abstracted safety- in the peripheral system of the machine that is not related block diagram (Figure 6.16, see Page 78). It quickly expected by the control system, the cycle is halted becomes clear from this example that the safety function and the machine assumes the safe state. is executed in two-channel mode. Category 3 or 4 may therefore be considered. The high-quality test measures, • Pressing the actuators S1 and S2 causes the rising by which combinations of faults can also be controlled, edges of the signals to be fed to the two processing suggest Category 4. This is demonstrated explicitly by the channels K1 (microcontroller) and K2 (ASIC). Provided verification step in Chapter 7, as is checking of the quan- these signals satisfy the requirements for simul- titative requirements for the MTTF , DC and CCF (see D avg taneity (500 ms) in accordance with the relevant below).
