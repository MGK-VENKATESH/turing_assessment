environmental conditions (25 + 10) • The subsystems B1/B2 and Q1/Q2 each satisfy Category 4 with a high MTTF and high DC (99%). This results in D avg an average probability of dangerous failure of 2.3 · 10–9 per hour for each subsystem. Following addition of the sub- system K1, the average probability of dangerous failure is 4.6 · 10-9 per hour. This satisfies PL e. 227 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS Figure 8.67: Determining of the PL by means of SISTEMA 228 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS 229 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS 8.2.35 Two-hand control – Category 4 – PL e (Example 35) i Changes with respect to the second edition (BGIA Report 2/2008e): The PFH value for the logic unit K1 and the B values for the pushbuttons S1 and S2 were brought into line with more D 10D realistic manufacturers‘ values Enable 13 21 13 21 S1 S2 14 22 14 22 K1 Logic unit Type III C to DIN EN 574 K2 K3 Figure 8.68: Two-hand control, signal processing by a logic device with downstream contactor relays Safety function • Controlled location of the operator‘s hands outside the hazard zone during a hazardous movement: when at least one of the two pushbuttons S1/S2 is released, enabling is cancelled and remains blocked until both pushbuttons are released and pressed again synchronously. Functional description • The logic unit K1 monitors operation of the actuators (pushbuttons) S1 and S2. Only when both pushbuttons are operated synchronously (i.e. within a maximum time of 500 ms as specified in EN 574) from within the released state do the contactor relays K2 and K3 pick up, resulting in enabling. When at least one of the pushbuttons S1/S2 is released, K2/K3 cancel enabling. • K2 and K3 have the function of contact
