a mechanical stop – The actuator is mounted such that it cannot be removed – Regular maintenance is performed – Positive coupling following fitting – Adequate mechanical strength of all mounting and functional elements – Dropping of the door does not lead to the actuator being used outside the range specified by the manufacturer – Damage that could be caused by foreseeable external influences (such as the ingress of dirt or dust; mechanical shock) is prevented by the form of mounting or need not be anticipated under the given conditions of use • B2.1 and B2.2 are switching elements of the guard locking device with direct opening contacts in accordance with IEC 60947-5-1, Annex K. The manufacturer states a B value for the purposes of calculation. 10D • B3 is a direct opening contact in accordance with IEC 60947-5-1, Annex K, and has the purpose of monitoring the door position. • K4 and K5 possess mechanically linked contacts to IEC 60947-5-1, Annex L. • The safety modules K1 and K2 detect cross-circuits and shorts to earth, and satisfy the requirements of Category 4, PL d of EN ISO 13849-1. • The stationary state monitor consists of the sin/cos encoder B4 and the standstill monitor K7. Both satisfy the requirements of Category 4 and PL e. 165 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS Calculation of the probability of failure • Fault exclusion can be assumed for the mechanism of the guard locking device B1. Note: On guard locking devices with fail-safe locking element, fault exclusion is possible only in accordance with the manufacturer‘s information. • The manufacturer states a B value of 3,000,000 cycles [M] each for the switching elements B2.1 and B2.2. At 10D actuation once every 10 minutes, n is 17,520 cycles per year and the MTTF is 1,712 years.
