• Failure of functional elements of the valve (reset function, switching function, sealing function) • Contamination of the fluid Contamination constitutes unintended use and generally leads to malfunctions. A general rule for all valves is that contamination leads to premature wear, thus negating the essential prerequisites used for design and dimensioning based on a defined probability of failure. The mechanical springs for the reset function used in monostable valves are generally designed for high endur‐ ance and can be considered proven in accordance with ISO 13849-2. However, exclusion of failure in the event of the springs breaking is not possible. An important differentiating factor between the valves is the design of the moving switching element inside the valve. The failure mode for each valve is essentially determined by its design. Poppet valves might leak, but in piston valves, the piston slide might jam. With a poppet valve, the switching function is effected by the moving switching element (valve plate), which changes position relative to a seat inside the housing. This design enables large cross-sections to be released with short strokes. The risk of leaks can be excluded with an appropriate design. In the case of piston valves, the valve body closes or opens the flow path by moving over a bore or circumferential groove. The changes in the cross-section of the piston slide relative to the changes in cross-section inside the housing affect volume flow and are known as control edges. An essential feature of this valve design worthy of note is what is known as the lap. The lap is the longitudinal distance between the stationary and moving control edges of the slide valve. Due to the gap between the piston and the housing bore required for hard-sealing valves, a leak will occur in the event of a pressure
