be observed. A stable power supply is particularly important in safety-related applications. For this reason, the power supply should be able to bridge brief power outages. 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 31 Subject to change without notice 2 SAFE DESIGN (INHERENTLY SAFE DESIGN) Earthing system The earthing system characterizes both the type of connection on the secondary side of the supply transformer to earth and the type of earthing for the electrical equipment’s chassis. Three earthing systems are standardized internationally: • TN system • TT system • IT system Earthing is an electrically conductive connection to the earth. A differentiation is made between protective earthing (PE), which is related to electrical safety, and functional earthing (FE), which is used for other purposes. The protective conductor system comprises earth electrodes, connecting cables, and the related terminals. For equipotential bonding, all conductive and accessible parts of the machine must be connected to the protective conductor system. Equipotential bonding is a basic means of protection in the event of a fault.

In the TN system, the star point of the transformer is directly connected to earth (system earthing). The chassis of the equipment connected are connected to the transformer’s star point via the protective conductor (PE). Depending on the wire cross-section laid, PE and N conductors are laid as a common conductor (TN-C system) or as two independent conductors (TN-S system). TT system In a TT system, the star point of the supply transformer is earthed in the same way as in a TN system.
