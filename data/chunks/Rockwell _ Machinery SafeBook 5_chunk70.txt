(parallel approach). These mountings are not considered angled if they are within ±5° of the intended design. When the angle exceeds ±5°, the potential risks (e.g. shortest distance) of foreseeable approaches must be taken into consideration. In general, angles greater than 30° from the reference plane (e.g. fl oor) should be considered normal and those less than 30 considered parallel. Safety Mats With safety mats, the safety distance must take into account the operators pace and stride. Assuming the operator is walking and the safety mats are mounted on the fl oor. The operator’s fi rst step onto the mat is a depth penetration factor of 1200mm or 48 in. If the operator must step up onto a platform, then the depth penetration factor can be reduced by a factor of 40% of the height of the step. It is important to fi x the mat(s) securely to prevent any movement. Example Example: An operator uses a normal approach to a 14mm light curtain, which is connected to a monitoring safety relay which is connected to a DC powered contactor with a diode suppressor. The safety system response time, Tr, is 20 + 15 + 95 = 130ms. The machine stopping time, Ts+Tc, is 170ms. A brake monitor is not used. The Dpf value is 1 inch, and the C value is zero. The calculation would be as follows Dpf = 3.4 (14 - 6.875) = 1in (24.2mm) C = 8 (14-14) = 0 Ds = K x (Ts + Tc + Tr + Tbm) + Dpf S = K x T + C Ds = 63 x (0.17 + 0.13 + 0) + 1 S = 1600 x (0,3) + 0 Ds = 63 x (0.3) + 1 S = 480mm (18.9in) Ds = 18.9 + 1 Ds =
