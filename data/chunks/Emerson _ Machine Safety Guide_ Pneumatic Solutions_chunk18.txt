Further examples can be found at www.emerson.com/ The structures of most fluid power system controls are designed en-us/expertise/automation/improving-safety-security/ to comply with the categories 1, 3, or 4. Because category B machine-safety already requires compliance with the relevant standards and 26 Machine safety | Emerson expertise Circuit example: “Safe exhaust” (Cat. 3), potential PL a-e The basic valve position depressurizes the system. Redundant safe exhaust is guaranteed via two exhaust pathways: • Via non-return valves 2V2 and 2V3 and the directional valve 2V1. The minimum opening pressure of the non-return valves must be taken into account. • Via directional valve 1V1 Cylinder extension and retraction is only possible with the combined actuation of 1V1 and 2V1. The safety-related switching position is achieved by removing the electrical control signal. Failure of one of the valves does not jeopardize the safety function. 1S1 1S2 1A1 2V3 12 2 1 2V2 2S1 12 2 1 P 1V1 4 2 2V1 4 2 5 1 3 5 1 3 e Positive IFA rating achieved Basic valve position depressurizes the system – two exhaust pathways: • Via non-return valves 2V2 and 2V3 and directional valve 2V1 (observe minimum opening pressure of the non-return valves) • Via directional valve 1V1 • Valve 2V1 must
