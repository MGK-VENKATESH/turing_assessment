A clear relationship was also established between D upon failure rates for hydraulic piston-type directional the quality of the operating conditions and the attained control valves that were determined in a study conducted lifetime to failure over a defined period of observation. in the maintenance departments of two large-scale users of hydraulic equipment (referred to below as users A and D.2.3 MTTF of hydraulic control components D B). The failure rates were determined by the evaluation of computer data (quantities of re-ordered hydraulic Based upon the results of the above study, an MTTF D piston-type directional control valves, repair reports) of 150 to 1,200 years is proposed in EN ISO 13849-1 for and involvement in maintenance work. In addition to the hydraulic components, provided certain conditions are failure data for the valves, the operating conditions were met. The valves studied were primarily of the piston type. also taken into account. The comparability of the MTTF Owing to the similarity in failure behaviour, however, D values determined for the different users of hydraulic sys- the lifetime MTTF determined for these valves serves D tems is therefore assured. For validation and confirmation as a good estimation for all safety-related hydraulic of these data, further failure data were collected by a sur- valves.
