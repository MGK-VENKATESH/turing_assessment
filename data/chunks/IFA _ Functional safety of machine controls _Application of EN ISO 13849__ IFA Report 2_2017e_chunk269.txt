diverse technology must be employed in the two channels in the intended PL of d. • In accordance with EN 415-4, it can be assumed that the unobserved access of persons through feed or discharge openings is prevented sufficiently reliably when requirements including the following are met: – Use of a two-beam or three-beam light barrier in consideration of the necessary installation height (with the access point open/an empty pallet present in it), or – Muting of the protective function of the light barrier by the loaded pallet with clearances to the side of less than 0.2 m, and muting activated by the pallet load only immediately prior to interruption of the light beams (without greater timing intervals and geometrical gaps). Calculation of the probability of failure In the calculation below, a DC of 0% is assumed for the output relays of the muting sensors F1 to F4, since the con- tacts employed for muting are not subject to automatic fault detection. For this reason, periodic manual inspection that can be achieved by simple means is specified. • MTTF : an MTTF of 100 years [E] is assumed for the sensor part of each of the muting sensors F1 to F4. A B value D D 10D of 2,000,000 cycles [E] applies for the output relays of F1 to F4. At 300 working days, 16 working hours and a cycle time of 200 seconds, n is 86,400 cycles per year and the MTTF 232 years for these elements. An MTTF of op D D 35 years (“high”) is produced for the channel. • DC : a DC of 90% is attained for the sensor part of the muting sensors F1 to F4 by way of the PLC monitoring. The avg DC for the output relays is estimated erring on the
