In such cases, the standard is said to give rise • “Overlapping hazards” included to a “presumption of conformity”, since its application justifies the assumption that the machine satisfies the • Information on the F1/F2 distinction updated requirements of the EC Machinery Directive. The strategy for risk reduction must however always be followed where • Consideration for the “probability of a hazardous a standard giving rise to the presumption of conformity event occurring” inserted does not exist, where a suitable standard exists but the design has deviated from it, or where additional aspects • Subclause 5.4.2, “Transition from a required Category apply that are not covered by the product standard.
