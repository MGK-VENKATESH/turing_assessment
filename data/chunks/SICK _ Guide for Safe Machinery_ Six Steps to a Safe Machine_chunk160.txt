This creates new challenges for information security and must be taken into account to prevent injury to persons or damage to machines and systems or the environment. Consequently, this necessitates an overall assessment of machine safety and information security aspects by component manufacturers, machine manufacturers, system integrators and plant operators. The overall assess‐ ment always starts with defining the limits of the machine (usage limits and spatial limits). The limits also include communication interfaces relevant to cybersecurity, both between humans and machines, between machines and the control system, and between machines. A risk assessment or hazard assessment is performed based on these limits. Based on the risk analysis, all sources of danger are analyzed and appropriate measures taken. Cybersecurity attacks do not create new hazards in terms of machine safety, but the effectiveness of protective measures can be negatively impacted or interrupted. For example, the system components
