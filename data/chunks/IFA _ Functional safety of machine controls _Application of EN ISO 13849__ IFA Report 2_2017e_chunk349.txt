The 259 Annex C C.3.1 Applicable to all technologies projections, needle-like in form, may attain lengths of over 1 mm (note: a much lower value is stated in [1]) and cause electrical short circuits. The prevailing theory is • Use of suitable materials and adequate manufacturing that whiskers are caused by pressure arising during the tinning process.
