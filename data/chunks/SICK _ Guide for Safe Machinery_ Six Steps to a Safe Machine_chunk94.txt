The contacts on the electrical control switches must be positive opening normally closed contacts. The actuators must be red. The background must be yellow, if present and technically possible. The following types of control device may be used: • Switches actuated with mushroom head pushbuttons • Switches actuated with wires, ropes, or rails • Foot switches without protective cover (only for emergency stop and only if other solutions cannot be used) • Mains disconnecting devices operated by handles according to IEC 60204-1 90 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION Figure 74: Emergency stop control switches in various designs If wires and ropes are used as actuators for emergency stop devices, they must be designed and attached so that they are easy to actuate. Reset devices shall be arranged so that the entire length of the wire or rope is visible from the location of the reset device. Measures must be taken to prevent loss of the emergency stop function due to breakage or unhooking of the wires or ropes. Neither the emergency stop actuator nor the background must be marked with text or symbols. If needed for clarification, only the following symbol (IEC 60417-5638) may be applied: Figure 75: Symbol IEC 60417-5638: Emergency stop To avoid confusion between actuation (e.g., pressing an actuator) and release (e.g., turning an actuator), the marking for release must be the same or approximately the same color as the actuator. Emergency stop control switches must be mounted in such a way that their actuation cannot be prevented by simple means or blocked unintentionally. Actuating surfaces with locks for resetting should be avoided. If such emergency stop control switches are used, the operating instructions for the machine must provide information on
