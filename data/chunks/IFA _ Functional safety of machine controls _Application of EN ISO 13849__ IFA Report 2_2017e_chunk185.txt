Correct implementation of the measure mode responses of the firmware of the microcontroller shall be demonstrated by an analysis of development K1. In other words: it is clarified whether the require- documentation such as circuit diagrams, and by tests ments of the specification have been implemented on the hardware. The diversity employed for K1 and K2 correctly in the software. makes a substantial contribution to the CCF: the diffe- 96 7 Verification and validation • Checking of the assessment of the PL 7.8.3 Examination of whether all safety functions have been analysed The simplified procedure according to EN ISO 13849-1 (see also Block 8 in Figure 7.1) was applied for estimation of the PL. Its correct application is confirmed. Calculation of the MTTF in The V&V activities shown here for SF2 are conducted for D accordance with subclause 6.2.11 and Annex D and of all safety functions performed by the SRP/CS (SF1 to SF6). the average diagnostic coverage DC in accordance The additional effort is however low, since many safety avg with Annex E is checked, as is correct determining of the functions employ the same hardware. The analyses and PL from the previously confirmed Category, MTTF , and tests shall show that the safety functions have been D DC values by means of the bar chart shown in Figure implemented correctly. Once all safety functions have avg 6.10. been analysed, evaluation according to EN ISO 13849-1 and -2 is complete. • Verification of the information for use The information for use shall be reviewed concerning the two-hand control.
