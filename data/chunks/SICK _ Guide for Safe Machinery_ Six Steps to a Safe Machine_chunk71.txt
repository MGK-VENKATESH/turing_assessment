protective device can be used if the operator is not exposed to any danger of injury due to ejected parts (e.g., splashes of molten material). Safety light curtains and safety light-beam sensors (AOPD) AOPDs are protective devices that use optoelectronic transmission and reception elements to detect persons in a defined two-dimensional area. A series of paral‐ lel light beams (normally infrared) transmitted from the sender to the receiver form a protective field that safeguards the hazardous area. Detection occurs when an opaque object fully interrupts one or more beams. The receiver signals the beam interruption by a signal change (OFF state) to its output signal switching devi‐ ces (OSSDs). These signals from the OSSDs are used to stop the dangerous machine functions. The international standard IEC 61496-2 defines safety requirements for AOPDs. Typical AOPDs include safety single-beam sensors, safety multibeam sensors, and safety light curtains. AOPDs with a detection capability of more than 40 mm are called safety multibeam sensors. They are used to protect access to hazardous areas (see figure 44, page 70). Figure 44: Access protection using a safety multibeam sensor AOPDs with a detection capability of 40 mm or less are called safety light curtains and are used to safeguard hazardous points directly (see figure 45). With both safety multibeam sensors and safety light curtains, rather than all light beams being activated at the same time, they are usually activated and deac‐ tivated in rapid sequence one after the other. This increases resistance to interference from other sour‐ ces of light and increases their reliability accordingly. On state-of-the-art AOPDs, there is automatic synchro‐ nization between sender and receiver through an opti‐ 70 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION cal link.
