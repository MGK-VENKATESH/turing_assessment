The op D following formula applies: The figure for the switching frequency comprises operating B 10D hours/day [h ], working days/year [d ] as well as the switching MTTF = ---------------------------------------------------------------------- op op D 0,1×d ×h ×C frequency per hour [C]: op op General conditions according to the manufacturer: • B 10D = 2,600.000 MTTF D Range • C = 1 / h (assumed) Low 3 years ≤ MTTF < 10 years D • d = 220 d/a op Medium 10 years ≤ MTTF < 30 years • h = 16 h/d D op High 30 years ≤ MTTF < 100 years These boundary conditions result in an MTTF of 7,386 years per D D channel, which is interpreted as “high”. 4) Determination of DC DC Range As the contacts are positively guided, a high DC (99%) can be None DC < 60% derived from ISO 13849-1 according to the table. Low 60% ≤ DC < 90% Medium 90% ≤ DC < 99% High 99% ≤ DC Example: Determining the PL of the “power control elements” subsystem 5) Evaluation of the measures to prevent common cause failures Requirement Point Minimum Measures to avoid the common cause effect are implemented in s requirement multi-channel systems.
