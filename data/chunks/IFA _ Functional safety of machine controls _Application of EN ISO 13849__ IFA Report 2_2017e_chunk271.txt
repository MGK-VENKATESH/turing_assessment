G2 control employing n microcontrollers Safety functions • Safety-related stop function: when the pressure-sensitive edge is actuated, the revolving movement of the door is halted (SS1-r – safe stop 1 with ramp monitoring). This safety function is shown in the safety-related block diagram. • Safely limited speed (SLS): when a person or object is detected by the light barrier, the speed of the revolving door is reduced and safely limited. 182 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS G1 K1 T1s B1 T1 G2 K2 K3 Q1 Functional description • The revolving movement of the door is initiated only once the control system has been switched on by the pushbut- ton S1. In normal operation, the command for the revolving movement is issued by the motion detector B3 located on the door. The frequency inverter T1 is actuated jointly by the two microcontrollers K1 and K2. Each microcontrol- ler (µC) contains a central processing unit (CPU) in the form of a microprocessor, and working memory (RAM) and read-only memory (ROM). K1 controls the functions of setpoint assignment, STO1, and fast stop (T1s). K2 actuates STO2, and the brake Q1 can be released by means of the contactor relay K3. The rotary encoders G1 and G2 signal the motor speed to K1 and K2 respectively. The redundant speed monitoring is required for both safety functions (ramp monitoring and SLS), and is also used for monitoring of the frequency inverter T1. • Faults in the pressure-sensitive edge or light barrier are detected in the associated control units. The same applies to faults in the control units themselves, which are detected by internal monitoring. Faults in the components of the microcontrollers are detected by the performance of self-tests and by data comparison. When detected, faults are controlled via K1 and/or K2, leading to the door‘s
