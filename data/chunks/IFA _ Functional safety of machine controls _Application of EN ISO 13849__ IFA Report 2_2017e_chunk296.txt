Q1, and the MTTF is 274 years. At 365 working days, 16 working hours and a cycle time of 1 minute, D n is 350,400 cycles per year for Q2, and the MTTF is 37 years. For the channel consisting of F1 and Q1, this results op D in an MTTF of 85 years. Overall, the resulting symmetrized MTTF value per channel is 64 years (“high”). D D • DC : the DC of 99% for Q2 is based upon testing by means of the contactor monitoring module F1. A DC of 99% for avg F1 is achieved by fault-detection measures within the contactor monitoring module. The circuit-breaker Q1 is tested by means of the manual test function that is to be implemented; this produces a DC of 90%. A DC of 99% is substi- tuted for F1. Averaging thus yields a DC of 98% (“medium”). avg • Adequate measures against common cause failure (65 points): separation (15), overvoltage protection etc. (15) and environmental conditions (25 + 10) • The subsystem, comprising Q1, Q2 and F1, satisfies Category 3 with a high MTTF (64 years) and medium DC D avg (98%). This results in an average probability of dangerous failure of 4.4 · 10-8 per hour. This satisfies PL e. Following addition of the subsystem, comprising safeguard and safety module K1, the PL may under certain circumstances be lower. • In consideration of estimation erring on the safe side as described above, a T value of 3.7 years is produced for 10D the wearing element Q2 for replacement as specified. 211 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS Figure 8.59: Determining of the PL by means of SISTEMA 212 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS 213 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS 8.2.31 Pneumatic valve control (subsystem) – Category 4 – PL e (Example
