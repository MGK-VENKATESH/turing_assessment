The diagnostic coverage (DC) is a measure of the capability to detect dangerous errors. Poor diagnostics only detect a few errors, good diagnostics detect a large number of or even all failures. Instead of a detailed analysis (FMEA), the ISO 13849-1 standard contains various quantified measures. The DC is divided into various ranges: 134 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 3D – VERIFYING THE SAFETY FUNCTION Table 55: CCF measures with the maximum achievable values according to ISO 13849-1 Designation Range None DC < 60% Low 60% ≤ DC < 90% Medium 90% ≤ DC < 99% High 99% ≤ DC λ DC = 50% DD λ SFF= 75% S λ D Common cause failure (CCF) External influences (e.g., voltage level, overtemperature) can cause several identical components to become unusable at the same time, regardless of how infrequently they would otherwise fail or how well they have been tested. To illustrate this: When the light goes out, you can neither read the newspaper with one eye or with both eyes because it is dark. Such common cause failures must be prevented. Annex F of ISO 13849-1 provides a simplified method to evaluate measures taken against CCF. A maximum number of points is defined for each measure. Suitable points are awarded for each measure that has been applied.
