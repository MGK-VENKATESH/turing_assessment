until the device has been reset. Actuated emergency stop devices must be reset by hand locally. The reset must only prepare the machine to be put back into operation (see "Application of reset and restart", page 110). The operating instructions of the machine must provide information that after actuation and before resetting the control switch, the machine must be checked to determine the reason for the actuation. If the emergency stop control switch is operated by ropes or wires, the instructions must include checking the entire length of the ropes or wires. In the case of emergency stop control switches in porta‐ ble operator panels, resetting the emergency stop com‐ mand must only be possible after the actuated emer‐ gency stop control switch has been unlocked. If the area of operation of the machine is not fully visi‐ ble (see figure 73, page 90), an additional reset must be carried out by one or more reset buttons to avoid the risk of an unexpected start-up. This is to ensure that no persons are present in a danger zone or that persons in need of assistance remain undetected. Figure 73: Example of an area of operation that is not fully visible Emergency stop equipment The emergency stop function is a “safety function” and therefore the requirements of functional safety must be met (ISO 13849-1 or IEC 62061). The required reliability of the safety function (PL or SIL) should correspond to the purpose of the emergency stop function. The minimum requirement, however, is PL c according to ISO 13850 or SIL1 according to IEC 62061. The hydraulic and pneumatic equipment that performs an emergency stop function must comply with the require‐ ments of ISO 4413 or ISO 4414. The electrical equipment for emergency stop functions must meet the requirements of IEC 60204-1.
