Since in T B 10D 10D the case of valves, the “availability” failure criterion also MTTF D = 0,1 = 0,1 · n (D.3) op encompasses failures that are not relevant to safety (e.g. leakage above the defined threshold), it has been set out This approximation is based upon reformulation in two in the standard that the value determined for the nominal steps. The B value, stated in the pseudo unit of “cyc- 10D life (B ) multiplied by two may be considered equal to the les”, is first converted to a T value. This value is the 10 10D B (dangerous) value (number of cycles until 10% of the elapsed time at which 10% of the components under ana- 10D components fail dangerously): lysis have failed dangerously: B = 2 ⋅ B (D.2) B 10D 10 T = 10D (D.4) 10D n op The B value is generally determined in the laboratory. For 10 this purpose, at least seven valves produced at different The average number of actuations per year n (stated in op times are subjected to endurance testing. The maximum cycles per year) serves as the conversion factor for this rate of operations for the endurance test is determined purpose. It is based upon the following parameters, which from the pressure build-up (attainment of 90% of the test must be estimated for the anticipated application (if pressure) and the pressure dissipation (attainment of appropriate, the worst-case scenario): 10% of the test pressure) in a connected volume that is defined according to the port cross-subclauses.
