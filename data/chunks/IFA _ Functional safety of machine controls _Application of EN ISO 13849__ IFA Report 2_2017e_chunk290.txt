contactor relay K2 possesses mechanically linked contact elements in accordance with IEC 60947-5-1, Annex L. • The contactors Q1 and Q2 possess mirror contacts in accordance with IEC 60947-4-1, Annex F. • The PLC K3 satisfies the normative requirements set out in subclause 6.3. Calculation of the probability of failure • The circuit arrangement can be divided into three subsystems as shown in the safety-related block diagram. The probability of failure of the safety module K1 is added at the end of the calculation (2.3 · 10-9 per hour [M], suitable for PL e). For the remaining subsystems, the probability of failure is calculated as follows. Since each guard door (guard) forms part of a dedicated safety function, calculation is shown here by way of example for safeguard 1. • MTTF : for the position switch B1 with direct opening action and roller actuation, the B is 20 · 106 switching cycles D 10D [M]. For position switch B2 (make contact), the B is 1 · 105 switching cycles [M]. At 365 working days, 16 working 10D hours per day and a cycle time of 1 hour, the n for these components is 5,840 cycles per year. The MTTF of B1 and op D B2 is 34,246 years and 171 years for B2 respectively. For the contactors Q1 and Q2, the B value corresponds under 10 inductive load (AC 3) to an electrical durability of 1,000,000 switching cycles [M]. On the assumption that 50% of failures are dangerous, the B value is produced by doubling of the B value. The value assumed above for 10D 10 n results in an MTTF of 3,424 years per channel for Q1 and Q2. Altogether, the symmetrized MTTF value per op D D 203 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS channel in the two subsystems
