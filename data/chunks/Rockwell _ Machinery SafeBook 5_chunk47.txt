emergency stop device. The emergency stop device must be continuously operable and readily available. Operator panels should contain at least one emergency stop device. Additional emergency stop devices may be used at other locations as needed. Emergency Stop devices come in various forms. Push buttons and cable pull switches are examples of the more popular type devices 39 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery Until recently, hardwired electro-mechanical components were required for emergency stop circuits. Recent changes to standards such as IEC 60204-1 and NFPA 79 mean that safety PLCs and other forms of electronic logic meeting the requirements of standards like IEC61508, can be used in the emergency stop circuit. Emergency stop devices are considered complimentary safeguarding equipment. They are not considered primary safeguarding devices because they do not prevent access to a hazard nor do they detect access to a hazard. They rely on human interaction. For further information on emergency stop devices, read ISO/EN13850, IEC 60947- 5-5, NFPA79 and IEC60204-1, AS4024.1, Z432-94. Emergency Stop Push Buttons When a push button is used as an emergency stop device, it must be mushroom shaped, red coloured and with a yellow background. When the emergency stop device is actuated, it must latch in and it must not be possible to generate the stop command without latching in. The resetting of the emergency stop device must not cause a hazardous situation. A separate and deliberate action must be used to re- start the machine. One of the latest technologies to be applied to emergency stops is a self-monitoring technique. An additional contact is added to the back estop that monitors whether the back of the panel components are still present. This is known as a self- monitoring contact block. It consists of a spring actuated contact that closes
