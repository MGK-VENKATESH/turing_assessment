C.2 and D.2 in the informative annexes of avoidance of an unsafe state EN ISO 13849-2 address well-tried safety principles. Well- tried safety principles are employed in order to minimize • No undefined states or exclude critical faults or failures and thus to reduce the probability of faults or failures with an influence upon the Undefined states in the SRP/CS must be avoided. The safety function. SRP/CS must be designed such that its state can be predetermined during normal operation and under all anticipated operating conditions. This is to be achieved for example by the use of components with defined response behaviour (switching thresholds, hysteresis) and with a defined sequence of operations. 261 Annex C C.5.1 Example of a well-tried component • Separation of non-safety and safety functions in mechanical technology In order to prevent unexpectec influences upon safety functions, the functions concerned are implemented • Spring separately from non-safety functions. A spring is deemed to be a well-tried component when C.4.4 Examples of well-tried safety principles the provisions in EN ISO 13849-2, Table A.2 concerning in programmable systems/software well-tried safety principles for the application of well- tried springs and the technical provisions for spring EN ISO 13849-2 does not describe well-tried safety prin- steels to ISO 4960 [8] are observed. ciples for the use of programmable systems and soft- ware.
