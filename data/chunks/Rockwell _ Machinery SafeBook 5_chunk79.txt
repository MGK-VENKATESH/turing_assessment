and mechanical. Although ISO 13849-1 is applicable to complex systems, it also refers the reader to IEC 61508 for complex software embedded components. The outputs of ISO 13849-1 are Performance Levels [PL a, b, c, d or e]. The original Category concept is retained but there are additional requirements to be satisfi ed before a PL can be claimed for a system. The requirements can be listed in basic form as follows: • The architecture of the system. Essentially this captures what we have become used to as Categories 66 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 System Design According to (EN) ISO 13849 • Reliability data is required for the constituent parts of the system • The Diagnostic Coverage [DC] of the system is required. This represents the effectiveness of fault monitoring in the system • Protection against common cause failure • Protection against systematic faults • Where relevant, specifi c requirements for software Later we will take a closer look at these factors but before we do, it will be useful to consider the basic intent and principle of the whole standard. It is clear at this stage that there are additional considerations to learn but the detail will make more sense once we have understood what the standard is trying to achieve and why. First of all why do we need the standard? It is obvious that the technology used in machine safety systems has progressed and changed considerably over the last ten years. Until relatively recently safety systems have depended on “simple” equipment with very foreseeable and predictable failure modes. Now we have an increasing use of more complex electronic and programmable electronic devices in safety systems. This has given us advantages in terms of cost, fl exibility and compatibility but it has also meant that the pre-existing standards are
