shall be selected and verified so that they can withstand or are immune to the expected disturbances. Increased requirements apply to safety components. Electromagnetic disturbances can arise from the following causes: • Fast, transient, electrical disturbances (burst) • Surge voltages, e.g., caused by lightning strikes to the grid • Electromagnetic fields • High-frequency disturbance (neighboring cables) • Electrostatic discharge (ESD) The limits for interference immunity and interference emission are different for industrial and residential applica‐ tions. More stringent requirements apply to components in the industrial sector. On the one hand they must withstand stronger disturbances, but on the other hand they are allowed to interfere more strongly. Components that meet the RF interference requirements in the industrial sector may cause RF interference in residential areas. The following table shows examples of the typical interference immunity in a number of areas of application, in each case in the frequency range from 900 to 2 000 MHz.
