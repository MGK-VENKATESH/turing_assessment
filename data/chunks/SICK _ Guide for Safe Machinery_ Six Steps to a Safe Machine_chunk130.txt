fitted to the output circuit on the inverter? • Connection cables as short as possible and shielded? • Components and screens connected to earth/equipment earthing conductor using large area connections? • Commutation choke connected in series for peak current limiting? Safety functions on servo amplifiers and frequency inverters Different cut-off paths are possible when implementing the safety function: Drive Motor Figure 105: Safety-relevant elements and functions for circuits with servo and frequency inverters 1 Mains contactor – poor due to long re-energization time, high wear due to the current on the switch 2 Controller enable – not safety-related 3 Pulse inhibit “safe restart interlock (stop)” 4 Setpoint – not safety-related 5 Motor contactor – not allowed on all inverters 6 Retaining brake – normally not a functional brake The contribution of the drive to the safety function can be implemented in various ways: • By disconnecting the supply of power, e.g., using a mains contactor 1 or a motor contactor 5 • By external monitoring circuits, e.g., by monitoring an encoder • By safety sub-functions integrated directly in the drive ("Safety sub-functions integrated in the drive", page 121) 120 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION Disconnection of the supply of power When using inverters, the energy stored in the intermediate circuit's capacitors and the energy produced by a regenerative braking process must be taken into account in the risk assessment. During the consideration of the residual travel, it is to be assumed that the motion control system does not initiate a brake ramp. After shutdown, the drive continues running at more or less the same speed, depending on the friction (stop category 0). The use of a brake ramp by changing the setpoint and/or controller
