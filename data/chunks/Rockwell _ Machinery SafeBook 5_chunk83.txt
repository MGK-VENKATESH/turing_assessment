to help with the documentation and calculation aspects. It also produces a technical fi le. SISTEMA is available in a range of languages including German and English. IFA, the developer of SISTEMA, is a well-respected research and testing institution based in Germany. It is particularly involved in solving scientifi c and technical problems relating to safety in the context of statutory accident insurance and prevention in Germany. It works in cooperation with occupational health and safety agencies from over 20 countries. Experts from the IFA, along with their BG colleagues had signifi cant participation in the drafting of both (EN) ISO 13849-1 and IEC/EN 62061. The “library” of Rockwell Automation safety component data for use with SISTEMA is available at: www.rockwellautomation.com, under Solutions & Services > Safety Solutions. 69 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery Whichever way the calculation of the PL is done it is important to start from the right foundation. We need to view our system in the same way as the standard so let’s start with that. System Structure Any system can be split into basic system components or “subsystems.” Each subsystem has its own discrete function. Most systems can be split into three basic functions; input, logic solving and actuation [some simple systems may not have logic solving]. Input Logic Output Subsystem Subsystem Subsystem The component groups that implement these functions are the subsystems. Input Output Subsystem Subsystem Limit Switch Safety Contactor Interlock switch and safety contactor A simple single channel electrical system example is shown above. It comprises only input and output subsystems. 70 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 System Design According to (EN) ISO 13849 Input Logic Output Subsystem Subsystem Subsystem Output to other systems Limit Switch 440C-CR30 Safety Contactor Interlock switch, safety controller and safety contactor The system shown above is
