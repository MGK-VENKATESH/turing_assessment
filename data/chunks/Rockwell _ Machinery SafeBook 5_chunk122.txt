safety function to be implemented by a safety system ISO TR 23849 explains that it is not normal to rely upon fault exclusions to achieve this level of performance. This is dependent upon the technology used and the intended operating environment. Therefore it is essential that the designer takes additional care on the use of fault exclusions as that the PL or SIL increases. For example fault exclusion is not applicable to the mechanical aspects of electromechanical position switches and manually operated switches (e.g. an emergency stop device) in order to achieve a PLe or SIL3 system. Those fault exclusions that can be applied to specifi c mechanical fault conditions (e.g. wear/corrosion, fracture) are described in Table A.4 of ISO 13849-2. Therefore a guard interlocking system that has to achieve PLe or SIL3 will need to incorporate a minimum fault tolerance of 1 (e.g. two conventional mechanical position switches) in order to achieve this level of performance since it is not normally justifi able to exclude faults, such as, broken switch actuators. However, it may be acceptable to exclude faults, such as short circuit of wiring within a control panel designed in accordance with relevant standards. 107 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery Stop Categories according to IEC/EN 60204-1 and NFPA 79 It is both unfortunate and confusing that the term “Category” in relation to safety related control systems has different meanings. So far we have discussed the categories that originated in EN 954-1. They are a classifi cation of the performance of a safety system under fault conditions. There is also a classifi cation known as “Stop Categories” that originated in IEC/EN 60204-1 and NFPA 79. There are three Stop Categories. Stop Category 0 requires immediate removal of power to the actuators. This is sometimes considered
