with safely limited speed on a printing press – Category 3 – PL d/c (example 24) i Changes with respect to the second edition (BGIA Report 2/2008e): • B1 was replaced by a variant with two direct opening contacts (instead of a break/make contact combination). • A second encoder G2 on the machine shaft was added to the existing encoder G1 on the motor shaft. • The frequency inverter T1 was replaced by a variant with integral STO safety function. • The Category 3 subsystem B1 was grouped with the downstream Category 3 subsystem comprising G1, G2 and K1 to K4.
