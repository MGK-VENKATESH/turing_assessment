Only in exceptional cases is In two-channel Category 3 and 4 systems, the test rate it acceptable to rely here upon manual intervention, for is in competition with the frequency of incidence of example by the machine operator, since experience in a second dangerous failure, since only if the second practice shows that the necessary measures are often channel fails before a test has detected the failure of not adequately implemented, whether out of idleness, the first channel does a danger exist of the safety func- or owing to pressure of work or poor information or tion not being executed. As per the definition, Category organization. Effective implementation of manual tests 4 systems even tolerate the accumulation of undetected involves greater involvement in the work process, or faults. In practice, a range of recommendations exist for greater organizational effort and discipline. Calculation the minimum necessary test rate in Categories 3 and 4. of the DC nonetheless takes account of fault detection when a demand is made upon the safety function, i.e. IEC 61800-5-2 [20] governing the safety of electrical consideration is not limited to tests initiated automati- power drive systems considers the following minimum cally by programmable electronics; electromechanical diagnostic test frequencies acceptable for the case in components such as relays or contactors constitute which testing cannot be performed without interruption classic cases in which the fault of a “failure to drop of the machine's working cycle and in which no reaso- out” can typically be detected only when a demand is nable technical solution can be implemented: one test made upon the safety function.
