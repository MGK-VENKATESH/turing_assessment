In addition, inching mode is often sidered: this leads to the need for control devices to permitted only for a limited distance or duration, and/or EN 60947-5-1 to be used, even for the two PL b variants with the SLS safety function (safely limited speed) activa- in Table D.8, for example in order to exclude the short- ted. These measures cannot be quantified during determi- circuiting of adjacent contacts that are isolated from each ning of the PL (for example by means of SISTEMA), since as per Table D.8 of EN ISO 13849-2. they are dependent upon intentional action.
