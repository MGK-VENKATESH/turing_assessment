generator P1) is output; only when S1 is released and pressed again does the drive start up, with delay. • Faults in K1 and K2 are detected by a status comparison in K4. K4 also monitors K3 by monitoring the input and output information. Some faults in K3 also become evident through faults in the process. Self-tests (e.g. temporal program sequence monitoring by an internal watchdog) are performed in K4; in addition, K3 uses K4 for regular selection of STO1, and monitors the feedback signal from T1. • Together with the sin/cos encoder G1, the frequency inverter T1 forms a closed-loop control system in which faults (printing errors, paper tears) are revealed by the production process, which is highly synchronous. The encoder signals from G1 on the motor shaft are also read into K4 and monitored in T1 for plausibility of the sin/cos infor- mation (sin2 + cos2 = 1). Redundantly to this, the signals from a diversely engineered encoder G2 on the machine shaft are also interpreted. Although the two encoders are not located on the same shaft, their values, read into K4/K3 and converted into paper speeds, can be compared in K4, thereby providing fault detection for G1 and G2. Fault detection for STO1 in T1 is implemented by provision of a feedback signal that is interpreted in K3. Correct execution of STO2 is monitored by internal test measures in T1; in the event of a fault, these measures initiate stop- ping. Design features • Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. Protective circuits (such as contact protection) as described in the initial paragraphs of Chapter 8 are implemented. • The break contacts of B1 satisfy IEC 60947-5-1, Annex K, and B1 complies with DGUV Information 203-079 governing the selection
