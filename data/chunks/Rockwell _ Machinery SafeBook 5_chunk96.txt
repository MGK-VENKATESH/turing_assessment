into clarifi cation of this issue. In the meantime the use of engineering judgment and common sense should be suffi cient to lead to the correct choice of DC range. Common Cause Failure In most dual channel [i.e. single fault tolerant] systems or subsystems the diagnostic principle is based on the premise that there will not be dangerous failures of both channels at the same time. The term “at the same time” is more accurately expressed as “within the diagnostic test interval”. If the diagnostic test interval is reasonably short [e.g. less than eight hours] it is a reasonable assumption that two separate and unrelated faults are highly unlikely to occur within that time. However the standard makes it clear that we need to think carefully about whether the fault possibilities really are separate and unrelated. For example, if a fault in one component can foreseeably lead to failures of other components then the resulting totality of faults are deemed to be a single failure. It is also possible that an event that causes one component to fail may also cause the failure of other components. This is termed “common cause failure”, normally abbreviated as CCF. The degree of propensity for CCF is normally described as the beta (β) factor. It is very important that subsystem and system designers are aware of the possibilities of CCF. There are many different types of CCF and, correspondingly, many different ways of avoiding it. (EN) ISO 13849-1 plots a rational course between the extremes of complexity and over simplifi cation. In common with EN/IEC 62061 it adopts an approach that is essentially qualitative. It provides a list of measures known to be effective in avoiding CCF.
