SAFE MACHINERY | SICK 3-93 Subject to change without notice Technical protective measures Risk reduction Summary: Verification of the safety function General • Verify that the intended safety functions conform to the required safety level. To do this, verify mechanical and functional safety. Methods • Determine the resulting level of safety as per ISO 13849-1 (PL). Available methods: • Simplified method (based on PL) 1 • Detailed method (based on PFHd values) 1 • If neither the PL nor the PFHd value is known, determine the safety level of the subsystem from the following parameters: structure, reliability, diagnostics, resistance, and process. • Alternatively, determine the resulting level of safety as per IEC 62061 (SIL). Here it is also possible to determine the safety level of a subsystem that is not certified. Help • Use the recommended tools and seek advice. 3 3 d d 3-94 GUIDE FOR SAFE MACHINERY | SICK 7028282/2014-09-08 Subject to change without notice Risk reduction Technical protective measures Risk reduction Technical protective measures Step 3e: Validation of all safety functions 1 3 e Validation is the checking of a theory, a dance with specification is assessed, plan, or a proposed solution in relation validation is about the ultimate assess- to a problem that needs to be solved. ment of a solution in general terms with Unlike verification, where only the correct regard to its suitability to reduce risk as implementation of a solution in accor- required.
