failure of which is already considered in the downstream Category 3 subsystem and need not therefore also be considered in addition in the test channel. So as not to provoke an error message in SISTEMA, an MTTF value of 100 years is substituted in the test channel. Since testing is performed D immediately upon demand of the safety function, an adequate test rate is assured. The separate subsystem of S1 thus attains an average probability of dangerous failure of 5.3 · 10-7 per hour. Since it is not practicable for the con- trol system to bring about the safe state automatically in the event of the inching button sticking, and the PL is not r greater than c, involvement of the operator is also permissible (see subclause 6.2.5). • K1 + K3 and K2 + K4 are considered in two channels of a Category 3 subsystem in all three safety functions under analysis. 100 years [M] for K1 and K2, 50 years [M] for K4 and 30 years [M] for K3 are substituted for the MTTF . The D DC of 99% for K1 and K2 is produced by direct comparison of the supplied status information in K4. The DC of 99% 188 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS for K3 is based upon parallel processing of all safety-related information in K4 and upon the direct comparison in K4 with the intermediate results and output signals formed by K3. The self-tests implemented in K4 together with partial monitoring by the selection of STO1 read back by K3 result in a DC of 60% for K4. • Adequate measures against common cause failure (70 points): separation (15), FMEA (5), overvoltage protection etc. (15) and environmental conditions (25 + 10) • T1, including its integrated safety function STO, is considered in the analysis
