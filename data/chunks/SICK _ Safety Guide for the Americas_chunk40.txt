The definition of an “acceptable” level of residual substitution by the process risk is ultimately the decision of the owner of the equipment. changes in machine • Eliminate pinch points (increase In general, there is industry agreement that a risk reduction design clearance) • Automated material handling strategy should utilize a hierarchical approach. 2.
