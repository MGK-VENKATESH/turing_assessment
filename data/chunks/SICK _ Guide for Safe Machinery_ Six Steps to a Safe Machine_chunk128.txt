contact must be ensured even in Normally open contact the event of a fault (welded N/O contact). Since on contactors with low switching capacity (< 4 kW) there is essentially no difference between the main contact elements and the auxiliary contact elements, it is also possible to use the term “positively guided contacts” to refer to those small contactors. ≥0.5 mm Normally closed contacts On larger contactors, what are known as “mirror con‐ tacts” are used: While a main contact on a contactor is closed, no mirror contact (auxiliary normally closed Normally open contacts contact) is allowed to be closed. A typical application for mirror contacts is the highly reliable monitoring of the output state of a contactor in control circuits on machines. GA relleoM :ecruoS 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION Figure 102: Contact system of a contactor with positively guided contacts. A normally-open contact is welded. Suppressor elements Inductances such as coils on valves or contactors must be equipped with a suppressor to limit transient voltage spikes on shutdown. In this way the switching element is protected against overload (in particular against overvolt‐ age on particularly sensitive semiconductors). As a rule, such circuits have an effect on the release delay and, therefore, on the required minimum distance of the protective device (see "Approaches to calculating the minimum distance", page 100). A simple diode for arc suppression can result in a release (switch to OFF) time up to 14 times longer.
