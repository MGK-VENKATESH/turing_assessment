with the small difference between of minimizing effort, it is often advantageous only for MTTF and MTTF : what proportion of failures of a certain D safety-related components to be considered in the ana- component are dangerous? All conceivable failure modes lysis, i.e. components the failure of which could have an can be listed in a complex FMEA, evaluated as either indirect or direct negative influence upon performance “safe” or “dangerous”, and the fraction of their occur- of the safety function. For simplification purposes, fault rence estimated. Since the effects of a component failure exclusions are possible in addition; these take account upon the block determine whether the failure mode is of the fact that certain failures are extremely improbable safe or dangerous, detailed analyses of the effect caused and their contribution to the overall reliability negligibly by a failure may be necessary. A greater number of failure small. The assumption of fault exclusions is however modes may then prove to be “safe” than is the case with a subject to certain conditions; these are set out in detail simplified assessment, as proposed by EN ISO 13849-1: if in EN ISO 13849-2 and described more comprehensively the parts count method is used, its conservative approach in subclause 6.2.10. Conductor short circuits or certain assumes that overall, the safe and dangerous failures are mechanical failures can for example be excluded on the similar in number. In the absence of more detailed infor- basis of the design, provided certain conditions are met. mation, the MTTF is therefore always assumed with this D method to be double the MTTF. 6.2.12 Data sources for individual components Once again, the principle is that of the statistical mean, One of the questions most frequently posed in this con- i.e. an excessively favourable evaluation of one compo-
