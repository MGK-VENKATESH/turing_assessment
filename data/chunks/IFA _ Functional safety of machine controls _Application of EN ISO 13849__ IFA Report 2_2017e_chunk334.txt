The signal-pro- cessing elements of the “light barrier” function block (K1 Component failure rates may be obtained from a num- to K3, R2 to R9, C1) are required to behave in the same ber of sources. Examples for electronic components are way as in response to a “real” demand of the safety func- listed in [3 to 6]. These sources all contain generic data tion caused by interruption of the light beam. This test is relevant to multiple manufacturers. Collections of failure described below as “Test 1”. rates also exist for mechanical, pneumatic and hydraulic components. For certain components that are not listed B.2.2 Dangerous failure mode of a function in the relevant indexes (such as special ASICs), the failure block rate must be obtained from the manufacturer. Many com- mon quantification techniques, including the simplified The first step entails identification of the dangerous fail- method in EN ISO 13849-1 subclause 4.5.4, assume a con- ure mode of the function block. Generally, not only may stant failure rate over time. This represents an idealized individual elements fail, but an entire function block view. With appropriate dimensioning and, if necessary, may also fail in various ways as a result. The modes of preventive replacement, components can be prevented failure that are unfavourable from a safety perspective are from reaching the wear phase, during which the failure regarded as the “dangerous” failure mode of a function rate rises sharply, before the end of the mission time
