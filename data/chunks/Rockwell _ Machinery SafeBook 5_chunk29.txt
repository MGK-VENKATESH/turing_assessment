situation if each case is listed and addressed separately it may be possible to justify different protective measures for the maintenance technician than the ones for the cleaner. If the cases are not listed and addressed separately then the worst case should be used and the maintenance and the cleaner will both be covered by the same protective measure. Sometimes it will be necessary to carry out a general risk assessment on an existing machine that already has protective measures fi tted (e.g., a machine with dangerous moving parts protected by an interlocked guard door). The dangerous moving parts are a potential hazard that may become an actual hazard in the event of failure of the interlocking system. Unless that interlock system has already been validated (e.g., by risk assessment or design to an appropriate standard), its presence should not be taken into account. Risk Estimation This is one of the most fundamental aspects of risk assessment. There are many ways of tackling this subject and the following pages describe the basic principles. Any machinery that has potential for hazardous situations presents a risk of a hazardous event (i.e. of harm). The greater the amount of risk, the more important it becomes to do something about it. At one hazard the risk could be so small that we can tolerate and accept it but at another hazard the risk could be so large that we need to go to extreme measures to protect against it. Therefore in order to make a decision on “if and what to do about the risk,” we need to be able to quantify it. Risk is often thought of solely in terms of the severity of injury at an accident. Both the severity of potential harm AND the probability of its occurrence have to be
