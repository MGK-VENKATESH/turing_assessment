But, in order for a machine to be viable it must also be safe. Indeed safety must be regarded as a prime consideration. In order to devise a proper safety strategy there must be two key steps, which work together as shown below. RISK ASSESSMENT Identify all machines within the workplace—Then for each machine Consult relevant information and expertise MACHINE LIMITS NO Can you foresee all possible operation and use of the machine YES HAZARD IDENTIFICATION Identify each hazard situation— Then for each hazard RISK ESTIMATION Estimate the level of risk due to the hazard RISK REDUCTION Address the hazard by a RISK EVALUATION NO process of re-design or Is the level of risk additional measures acceptable Determine whether the performance and functional Have any safety measures been analyzed and NO characteristics of the safety measure are suitable for the proven adequate? machine and its type of use YES END OF SAFETY STRATEGY PROCESS 22 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety Strategy RISK ASSESSMENT based on a clear understanding of the machine limits and functions and the tasks that may be required to be performed at the machine throughout its life. RISK REDUCTION is then performed if necessary and safety measures are selected based on the information derived from the risk assessment stage. The manner in which this is done is the basis of the SAFETY STRATEGY for the machine. Following this a
