material does not cause the protective device to activate, but unmonitored areas are small enough to prevent unde‐ tected entry into the hazardous area by anyone (see figure 61). Alternatively, protective field switching can be per‐ formed independently by the protective device without the need for external sensors or signals (e.g., the Safe Portal system solution from SICK, see figure 58, page 78).

Blanking can be used to allow specific objects through the protective field, e.g., hose for cooling lubricant, slide/carrier for workpieces (see figure 62). For fixed blanking, the blanked area is precisely defined in terms of its size and position. For floating blanking, only the size of the blanked area is defined, not its position in the protective field (see table 30). If the object for which the blanking function in the pro‐ tective field had been configured, is no longer present in the protective field, there will be a gap in the protec‐ tive field of the AOPD. In this case, the AOPD can trigger Figure 62: Fixed blanking of light curtain beams on a trim‐ the safety function (off state). This prevents undetected ming press approach of parts of the human body to the hazard zone. If the blanked area is not completely covered by the blanked
