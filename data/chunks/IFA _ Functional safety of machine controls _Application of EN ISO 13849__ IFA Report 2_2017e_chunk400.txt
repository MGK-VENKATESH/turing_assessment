Their evaluation may vary as key values is applied here both for qualification of the a function of the design or external factors, such as the individual tests, and for definition of the DC . Since DC application in which the control system is operated.

For example, a DC value control channels. In general, evaluation as a numerical DC avg of 80% is reduced in the simplified approach to a value value makes no distinction between automatic tests (e.g. of 60% (in contrast to the procedure in the IFA SISTEMA program routines that are performed regularly) or delibe- software utility, which employs intermediate DC values rate tests (e.g. tests initiated manually by the operator at avg in its default setting; see Annex H).
