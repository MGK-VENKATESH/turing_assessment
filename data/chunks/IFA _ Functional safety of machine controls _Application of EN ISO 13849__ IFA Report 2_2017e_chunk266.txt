arrangement, refer also to Figure 8.44) are incorporated for control of the muting process. Via the inputs I1.2 to I1.5, the PLC monitors the actuation sequence of the four infrared light sen- sors via the sensor‘s contacts F1.1 to F4.1, in consideration of two programmed time settings. The muting function is implemented only in the output circuit of the PLC (output O1.2), independently of the output circuit of the light barrier F5. The muting contacts F1.2 and F2.2/F3.2 and F4.2, connected in series, are connected by OR logic via the diodes R2 and R3 respectively with the “enabling” function implemented by the contactor relays K2 and K3.

Faults in R2 or R3 cannot lead to unexpected muting (i.e. dangerous failure of the muting function). • Should the voltage break down and be restored, or the light barrier F5 be interrupted and the muting function not be active, the contactor relays K2 and K3 are de-energized. The absence of latching-in under these circumstances prevents them from picking up again should the muting circuits be
