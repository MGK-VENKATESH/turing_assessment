design • Features of protective devices (see "Technology, selection and use of protective devices", page 60) Which protective devices are to be integrated and how they are to be integrated must be defined based on the above features. Features of the machine The following features of the machine shall be considered: • Ability to stop the dangerous movement at any time (if not possible, use guards or impeding devices) • Ability to stop the dangerous movement without additional hazards (if not possible, select different design/ protective device) • Possibility of hazard due to ejected parts (if yes: use physical guards) • Stopping times (knowledge of stopping times is necessary to ensure the protective device is effective) • Possibility of monitoring stopping time/overrun (this is necessary if changes could occur due to aging/wear) Features of the surroundings The following features of the surroundings shall be considered: • Electromagnetic disturbances, radiated interference • Vibration, shock • Ambient light, light interfering with sensors/welding sparks • Reflective surfaces • Contamination (mist, chips) 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 55 Subject to change without notice • Temperature range • Moisture, weather Human aspects The following human aspects shall be considered: • Expected qualification of the machine’s operator • Expected number of persons in the area • Approach speed (K) • Possibility of defeating the protective devices • Reasonably foreseeable misuse Features of the design A safety function is performed by several subsystems. It is always advisable to implement safety functions with certified safety components. Certified safety components will simplify the design process and subsequent verification. It is often not possible to implement a subsystem using only certified safety components that readily provide the level of safety (PL/SIL). In fact, the subsystem frequently has to be assembled from a number of discrete
