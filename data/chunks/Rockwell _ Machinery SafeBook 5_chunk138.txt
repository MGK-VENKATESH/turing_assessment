relay for proper status by using Connected Components Workbench software. 14 to 27 Repeat steps 1 through 13 using EI_01 in place of EI_00, and OSSD 2 in place of OSSD 1. 132 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Application Examples 28 Connect OSSD 1 to OSSD 2 (terminal EI_00 to terminal EI_01). After approximately 50 seconds, the SensaGuard switch trips. The 440C-CR30 safety relay trips. The status indicator on the SensaGuard switch fl ashes red. Monitor all status indicator LEDs for proper operation, and monitor the 440C-CR30 safety relay for proper status by using Connected Components Workbench software. 29 Disconnect OSSD 1 from OSSD 2. Neither the SensaGuard switch nor the 440C-CR30 safety relay respond. Press and release the Restart button on the 440C-CR30 safety relay. Neither the SensaGuard switch nor the 440C-CR30 safety relay respond. 30 Cycle power to the SensaGuard switch. Approximately fi ve seconds after power is restored to the SensaGuard switch, its status LED turns steady green. The blinking red Fault status indicator LED on the 440C-CR30 safety relay turns OFF. Monitor all status indicator LEDs for proper operation, and monitor the 440C-CR30 safety relay for proper status by using Connected Components Workbench software. 31 Press and release the Reset button on the 440C-CR30 safety relay. The red Safe Stop stack light must be OFF. The SOF1 output on the 440C-CR30 safety relay must energize the contactors. Monitor all status indicator LEDs for proper operation, and monitor the 440C-CR30 safety relay for proper status by using Connected Components Workbench software. Validation of Safe Response to Abnormal Operation – The safety system responds properly to all foreseeable faults with corresponding diagnostics.
