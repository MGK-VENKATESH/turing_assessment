components • Have seen successful large-scale use in the past in similar applications or • Have been manufactured and tested by applying principles that demonstrate suitability and reliability for safety-related applications. Annex B of ISO 13849-2 does not contain a list of well-tried pneumatic components. Basic conditions| Machine safety 17 Further parameters to determine Emerson can performance levels provide assistance! Before a final answer about the performance of a safety function can be given, MTTF , DC, and CCF must be defined. D Mean time to dangerous failure (MTTF ) D Assessment MTTF MTTF describes the mean duration in years until a D D Low 3 years ≤ MTTF < 10 years dangerous system component failure. D Medium 10 years ≤ MTTF < 30 years It is a statistical value for electrical/electronic D components, which is identified through trials or High 30 years ≤ MTTF D < 100 years (resp. < 2.500 years in Cat. 4) reliability prognoses based on failure probabilities for the components. c Source: ISO 13849 Formula for determining B MTTF = 10D MTTF D for a mechanical D 0,1 • n element in a channel: op B = B x 2 as recommended by IFA 10D 10 Mean n (actuations/year) op d • h • 3600s/h for the mechanical element: n = op op op t cycle d = day, h = hours, s = second Calculating the total MTTF 1 D for two different channels: 2 1 1 MTTF = MTTF + MTTF - + D 3 DC1 DC2 MTTF MTTF DC1 DC2 For our 2-channel example and taking into account the following operating data, for channel 1 this means: 220 d, 16 h/d, T = 10 s -> n = 1.267.200 cycles/year and a B value for the CD07 5/3 directional valve of 24.8
