results of the risk estimation, the risk assessment determines whether the application of protective measures is required and when the necessary risk reduction has been achieved. NOTE - Tools and tables: Technical Report – ISO/TR 14121-2 Scalable Risk Analysis and Evaluation Method (SCRAM) The method is used to evaluate the initial risk and to estimate the risk after applying inherently safe design measures. It also assists with estimating the effectiveness of the implemented technical protection measures and/or the information for use. This method, developed by SICK on the basis of ISO 12100, has proven itself over many years through its practicality, plausibility, and reliability in preventing errors. All 3 levels of risk reduction (3-step method) are considered by SCRAM: • Safe design • Technical protective measures • Information for use 24 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 1 – RISK ASSESSMENT table 3 and table 5 on the following pages provide the basic framework for SCRAM. table 3 makes it possible to consider both the extent of the damage and the probability of occurrence of that damage. The risk elements used in SCRAM include: • the severity of the injury • the exposure of the person to the hazard • the possibility of avoiding the hazard • the probability of occurrence of the hazard Table 3: SCRAM, Step 1 (main table for determining the risk index) Occurence Severity Exposure Avoidance O1 – O3 O1 O2 O3 E0 ÷ < 1 S1 E1 – E3 A1, A2 < 1 < 1 < 1 E0 ÷ ≤ 1 A1 < 1 < 1 1 E1 A2 < 1 1 1 S2 A1 1 2 2 E2 A2 1 2 2 A1 2 3 3 E3 A2 2 3 3 E0 ÷ 1 A1
