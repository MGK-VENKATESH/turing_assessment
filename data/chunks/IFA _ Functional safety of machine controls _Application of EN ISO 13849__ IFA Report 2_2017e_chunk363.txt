Provided the requirements for the fault exclusion A possible problem for users of the standard, particularly are observed and documented, this is generally the most at the point at which the revised EN ISO 13849-1 was first elegant means of considering the reliability of the mecha- published, was the lack of MTTF data for components nical components. These requirements include adequate D used in the SRP/CS [2]. In subclause 4.5.2, the standard resistance to the anticipated environmental influences, proposes a hierarchy of data sources. The first of these i.e. the validity of a fault exclusion depends upon the are manufacturer's data [M], followed by typical values selected application. Another requirement is that of ade- listed in the standard itself [S], and finally a very con- quate overdimensioning, which ensures for example that servatively estimated substitutional value of ten years. the mechanical components are subjected to stress only Since this substitutional value relates to a component, within the fatigue limit. If fault exclusion is not possible, and the lower limit of three years for the MTTF value is the good engineering practice procedure described below D soon reached where several components are employed may provide a means by which an MTTF value can be D in a channel, the MTTF values listed in the standard itself estimated. D were and are of particular importance. This will continue to be the case, at least until statement by the manufac- D.2.2 BIA-Report 6/2004, “Untersuchung des turers of MTTF values becomes the norm – including for Alterungsprozesses von hydrau lischen D components that were not developed from the outset for Wegeventilen” (study of the ageing use in SRP/CS. process of hydraulic directional control valves) D.2 Differences between technologies On hydraulic systems, valves warrant special conside- By its nature, the
