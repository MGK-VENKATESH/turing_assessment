Figure 110: Subsystems of a safety function and parameters for determining the safety level according to ISO 13849-1 and IEC 62061 Determining the achieved Performance Level (PL) Subsystems A safety function that is implemented using control measures generally comprises sensor, logic unit, and power control elements. Such a chain can include discrete elements such as guard interlocking devices or valves, but also complex safety controllers. Safety functions are therefore often divided into subsystems to reduce complexity. In practice, pre-certified subsystems are often used for safety functions. PL or PFH values are provided by the D manufacturer for these subsystems, e.g., for a safety light curtain or a safety controller. These values apply only for the mission time to be specified by the manufacturer. In addition to the quantifiable aspects, it is also necessary to verify the measures against systematic failures.
