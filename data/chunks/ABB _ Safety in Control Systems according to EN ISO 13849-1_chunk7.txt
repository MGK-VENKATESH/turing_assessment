is performed using safety devices, the control system that monitors these needs to be designed as Identify the safety functions specified in EN ISO 13849-1. Step 3 - Design and calculate the safety functions Determine PL r To begin with you need to identify the safety functions on the machine. (Examples of safety functions are emergency stop and monitoring of gate.) Design and implement the For each safety function, a PL should be established solution for the safety function r (which has often already been made in the risk assessment). The solution for the safety function is then designed and implemented. Once the design is complete, you can Calculate PL calculate the PL the safety function achieves. Check that the calculated PL is at least as high as PL and then validate the r system as per the validation plan. The validation checks that the specification of the system is carried out correctly and Verify that that the design complies with the specification.You will also PL â‰¥ PL r need to verify that the requirements that are not included in Yes the calculation of the PL are satisfied, that is, ensure that the Validate software is properly developed and validated, and that you No Have other have taken adequate steps to protect the technical solution require ments from systematic errors. been met?
