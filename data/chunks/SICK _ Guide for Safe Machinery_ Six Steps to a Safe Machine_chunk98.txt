The consideration of the minimum safety distance applies to ESPEs with two-dimensional protective fields, e.g., light curtains, single-beam photoelectric safety switches (AOPD), laser scanners (AOPDDR), or two-dimensional camera systems. There are three types of approach. After the stop initiating ESPE has been selected, the required minimum distance between the ESPE’s protective field and the nearest hazardous point is to be calculated. The following parameters shall be taken into account: • Stopping time of the machine • Response time of the safety-related control system • Response time of the protective device (ESPE) • Supplements according to the resolution capability of the ESPE, the protective field height, and/or the type of approach as well as the possibility of bypassing the protective field by reaching around, over or under it (see table 40, page 103). If the minimum distance to the hazardous area is too large and unacceptable from an ergonomic viewpoint, either the overall stopping time of the machine must be reduced or an ESPE with a better detection capability (smaller resolution) chosen. Risks due to a person possibly remaining undetected between the protective field of the ESPE and the hazardous point must be avoided by taking suitable measures against unexpected start-up: • Restart interlocks that require a manual reset • Additional device for detecting persons in the hazardous area (see table 40, page 103) NOTE The calculation of the minimum distance S for
