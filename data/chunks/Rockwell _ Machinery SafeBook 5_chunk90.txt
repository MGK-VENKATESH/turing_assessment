the MTTF of the combination of both channels of a two D channel subsystem. If the PFH of a two channel subsystem is known, it can simply D be entered directly in to SISTEMA MTTF of a Single Channel D This represents the average mean time before the occurrence of a failure that could lead to the failure of the safety function. It is expressed in years. It is an average value of the MTTF ’s of the “blocks” of each channel and can be applied to either a D system or a subsystem. The standard gives the following formula which is used to calculate the average of all the MTTF ’s of each element used in a single channel D or subsystem. At this stage the value of SISTEMA becomes apparent. Users are spared time consuming consultation of tables and calculation of formulae since these tasks are performed by the software. The fi nal results can be printed out in the form of a multiple page report. 1 Ñ 1 Ñ nj =Σ =Σ MTTF MTTF MTTF d i=1 di j=1 dj Formula D1 from (EN) ISO 13849-1 In most dual channel systems both channels are identical therefore the result of the formula represents either channel. If the system/subsystem channels are different the standard provides a formula to cater for this. 2 1 MTTF = MTTF +MTTF d 3 dC1 dC2 1 1 + MTTF MTTF dC1 dC2 This, in effect, averages the two averages. In the cause of simplifi cation it is also allowable to just use the worst case channel value. 77 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery The standard groups the MTTF into three ranges as follows:- D Denotation of MTTF of each Range of MTTF of each channel D D channel Low
