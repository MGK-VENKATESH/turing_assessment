This + +…+ MTTF MTTF MTTF value describes the achievable error detection rate. D1 D2 DN The DC value is defined as “... an expression for the effectiveness of diagnosis that can be described as the the ratio of the rate of detected dangerous After accounting for all typical errors, the DC in our example avg failures compared to the rate of all dangerous is 93%. This translates to a medium level of diagnostic coverage. failures.” Whether a specific failure qualifies as “dangerous” or “safe”, mainly depends on the definition of the safety function, or in other words on the intended 20 Machine safety | Basic conditions CCF – common cause failure CCF in our example Countermeasure for CCF Fluid technology Electronics Points Separation of signal paths Separation of tubing Air and creepage distance on activated circuits 15 Diversity E.g. different valves E.g. different processors 20 Protection against overvoltage, Setup acc. to EN ISO 4413 to EN Overvoltage protection 15 overpressure … ISO 4414 (pressure relief valve) (e.g. contactors, power pack) Use of well-tried components User 5 FMEA in development FMEA during initial system conception 5 Competence/training Qualification measure 5 Protection against contamination and EMC Fluid quality EMC test 25 Other effects (e.g. temperature, shock) Compliance with EN ISO 4413 and Observe ambient conditions as described 10 EN ISO 4414 and product spec in product spec Total CCF Total points(65 ≤ CCF ≤ 100): 95 CCF is a rating of measures to counteract “common cause failure,” or errors stemming from a common source, for example due to a high ambient temperature or intense electromagnetic interference.
