commissioning, e.g.: Proper selection, arrangement, assembly, installation – Manufacturing faults Components with compatible operating characteristics – Error during design (incorrect Ability to withstand specified environmental conditions selection, incorrect dimensioning, Components complying with an appropriate standard, defective software) with defined failure types – Error during integration (incorrect Function testing selection, incorrect wiring) INTEGRATION: Project management, documentation Black-box test In addition: · Following commissioning, e.g.: Measures for the control of failures – Power failure/fluctuation De-energization principle – Environmental influences Design for the control of voltage influences – Wear, overload Design for the control of environmental influences – Incorrect maintenance Program sequence monitoring (for software) „Safe“ data communication processes (bus systems) Automatic tests In addition: Redundant hardware/diverse hardware Positive mode of actuation Mechanically linked contacts/direct opening action Oriented mode of failure Over dimensioning would not appear particularly difficult to satisfy the systematic failures – and in some cases even as operating requirements for measures against common cause failure states – that must be controlled by the SRP/CS such that (CCF). the safe state is achieved and/or maintained. Since its third edition, the standard proposes that different safety Three examples will show that actual requirements may functions be provided for these scenarios: indeed vary according to application and technology, and that the general requirements may therefore also require a) Where power is available interpretation on occasion. b) Where power is not available Example 1: If it is assumed that power is normally available, assess- Measures for control of the effects of a power failure ment of the risk parameters for the two safety functions to EN ISO 13849-1 may yield different results.
