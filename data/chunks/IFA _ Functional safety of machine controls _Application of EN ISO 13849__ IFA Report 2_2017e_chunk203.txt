valve 1V3 that is well-tried for safety applications. • Failure of the directional control valve may result in loss of the safety function. The failure is dependent upon the reliability of the directional control valve. • No measures for fault detection are implemented. 110 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS 1V3 Design features • Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. • 1V3 is a directional control valve with closed centre position, sufficient overlap, spring-centred central position and fatigue-resistant springs. • The safety-oriented switching position is attained by cancellation of the control signal. • Where necessary, the manufacturer/user must confirm that the directional control valve is a component that is well-tried for safety applications. • The following specific measures are implemented to increase the reliability of the directional control valve: a pres- sure filter 1Z3 upstream of the directional control valve, and suitable measures on the cylinder to prevent dirt from being drawn in by the piston rod (e.g. effective wiper on the piston rod, see * in Figure 8.7) Calculation of the probability of failure • MTTF : an MTTF of 150 years is assumed for the directional control valve 1V3 [M]. This is also the MTTF value per D D D channel, which is capped to 100 years (“high”). • DC and measures against common cause failures are not relevant in Category 1. avg • The hydraulic control satisfies Category 1 with a high MTTF (100 years). This results in an average probability of D dangerous failure of 1.1 · 10-6 per hour. This satisfies PL c. Following the addition of further safety-related parts of the control system in the form of subsystems for completion of the safety function, the PL may under certain circumstances be lower.
