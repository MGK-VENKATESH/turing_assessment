with reasonable effort. The type and number of components required for the function are derived from the definition of the safety function. NOTE - Examples for the definition of safety functions: IFA Report 2/2017, “Functional safety of machine controls” Permanently preventing entry/access Access to a hazardous point is prevented by means of mechanical covers, barriers, or obstacles (referred to as physical guards). Examples: • Prevention of direct access to hazardous points using covers (see figure) • Distancing protective devices (e.g., tunnels) to pre‐ vent access to the hazardous points and allow the passage of materials or goods (see figure) • Prevention of access to hazardous areas using physical guards Figure 19: Preventing access to the hazardous point in a packaging machine by means of a tunnel 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 43 Subject to change without notice 3A – DEFINING THE SAFETY FUNCTIONS Temporarily preventing access Access to a hazardous point is prevented until the machine is in a safe state. Examples: • On request, a machine stop is initiated. When the machine reaches the safe state, the blocking of access by the safety locking device is released. • After disconnecting the power, a transfer key that allows access (opening the movable physical guard) is enabled.

Examples: • Protection hood with special viewing window on a milling machine to protect against ejected shav‐ ings and tool parts • Fence that can hold back a robot Figure 21: Retention of shavings in a processing machine by means of a
