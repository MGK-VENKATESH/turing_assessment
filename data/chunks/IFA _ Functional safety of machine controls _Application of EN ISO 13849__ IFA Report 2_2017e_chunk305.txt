be divided into three subsystems as shown in the safety-related block diagram. The probability of failure of the standard safety module K1 is added at the end of the calculation (2.3 · 10-9 per hour [M], suitable for PL e). For the remaining subsystems, the probability of failure is calculated as follows. • MTTF : for the position switch B1 with roller actuation, the B is 20 · 106 operation cycles [M]. For the position D 10D switch B2 (make contact element), the B is 1 · 105 operation cycles [M]. At 365 working days, 16 working hours 10D per day and a cycle time of 1 hour, n for these components is 5,840 cycles per year and the MTTF is 1,674 years op D for B1 and B2. For the contactors Q1 and Q2, the B value corresponds under inductive load (AC 3) to an electrical 10 dura bility of 1,000,000 operation cycles [M]. On the assumption that 50% of failures are dangerous, the B value 10D is produced by doubling of the B value. The value assumed above for n results in an MTTF of 3,424 years per 10 op D channel for Q1 and Q2. The position switch B2 exhibits a limited operation time of 17.1 years. Its replacement in good time is recommended. • DC : the DC of 99% for B1 and B2 is based upon plausibility monitoring of the break/make contact element combi- avg nations in K1. The DC of 99% for contactors Q1 and Q2 is derived from regular monitoring by K1 during start-up. The DC values stated correspond to the DC for the subsystem concerned. avg • Adequate measures against common cause failure in the subsystems B1/B2 and Q1/Q2 (70 points): separation (15), well-tried components (5), protection against overvoltage etc. (15) and
