Keys must be used to activate specific functions and operating modes, see table 27, page 68. Figure 1: When a key is removed, a stop signal is generated and the dangerous state is stopped. Figure 2: In the safe state (machine stopped), the safety locking device is unlocked and the door can be opened. Figure 3: The service technician takes the key inside the plant. Inside, the inserted key enables the “setup mode” operating mode. Dangerous machine movements can now be made at reduced speed (turning the robot sideways) by means of an enabling switch. Automatic operation is disabled in this situation. The key is then removed again, the service technician leaves the hazardous area, closes the door, and finally reinserts the key into the adapter. The door is locked and automatic operation is now possible again.

The risk of possible “fault masking” in the conventional series connection of the safety switches limits the achievable performance level and makes such series connection impermissible in some applications. Fault masking can occur when switches with volt-free contacts are connected in series.
