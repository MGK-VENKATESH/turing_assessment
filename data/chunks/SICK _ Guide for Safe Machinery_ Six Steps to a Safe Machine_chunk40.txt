Oil-based hydraulics required a circuit for the fluid (feed and return), while in pneumatics the exhaust air is discharged to the environment using acoustic attenuators. Design principles The basic principles for the safe application of fluid technology are described in ISO 4413 (hydraulics) and ISO 4414 (pneumatics). All parts of a fluid-related system are to be protected against pressures that exceed the maximum operating pressure of a subsystem or the rated pressure of a component. A danger shall not be caused by leaks in a component or in the pipework/hoses. Acoustic attenuators are to be used to reduce the noise caused by escaping air. The use of acoustic attenuators shall not produce any additional hazard; acoustic attenuators shall not cause any harmful back-pressure. 38 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 2 SAFE DESIGN (INHERENTLY SAFE DESIGN) Use in potentially explosive atmospheres Protection against explosions is a particularly safety-related task. People are placed at risk in the event of an explosion, e.g., due to uncontrolled radiation of heat, flames, pressure waves, and flying debris, as well as due to harmful reaction products and the consumption of the oxygen in the ambient air necessary for breathing. Explosions and fires are not among the most common causes of industrial accidents. They often result, however, in serious injuries and death as well as major economic damage. Where dust, flammable gases, or liquids are manufactured, transported, processed, or stored, a potentially explo‚Äê sive atmosphere may be produced, i.e., a mixture of fuel and atmospheric oxygen within the limits for explosions. If a source of ignition is present, an explosion will occur. 100 vol. % Oxygen concentration vol. % Mixture too lean: Explosive Mixture too rich: No self-ignition atmosphere No explosion Explosion limits 0 vol. % Concentration
