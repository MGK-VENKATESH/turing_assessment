is then 99% owing to direct monitoring in K5. The averaging formula for the DC yields a result of avg 64% (“low”). • Adequate measures against common cause failure (75 points): separation (15), diversity (20), FMEA (5) and envi- ronmental conditions (25 + 10) • The two-channel combination of the control elements satisfies Category 3. This yields an average probability of dangerous failure PFH of 3.9 · 10-7 per hour. This satisfies PL d. Addition of the probability of dangerous failure of D K4 and S3 yields an overall probability of failure of 7.4 · 10-7 per hour. This also then satisfies PL d. • The wearing contactor Q1 should be replaced after approximately 7.8 years (T ). 10D More detailed references • Werner, C.; Zilligen, H.; Köhler, B.; Apfeld, R.: Safe drive controls with frequency inverters.
