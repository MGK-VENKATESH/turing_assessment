be possible in a reasonably foreseeable manner. Bypassing can be made more difficult, for example by particular conditions for installation, such as shrouded installation (see also EN ISO 14119). • The power supply to the entire machine is switched off (stop Category 0 to IEC 60204-1). 106 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS B1 Q1 Calculation of the probability of failure • MTTF : B1 is a conventional proximity switch on a safety screen with an MTTF of 1,100 years [M]. For the under- D D voltage release of the motor starter Q1, the B value approximates to the electrical durability of 10,000 switching 10 cycles [M]. On the assumption that 50% of failures are dangerous, the B value is produced by doubling of the 10D B value. Assuming actuation once daily of the proximity switch, an n of 365 cycles per year for Q1 produces 10 op an MTTF of 548 years. For the combination of B1 and Q1, the MTTF for each channel is 365 years. This value is D D capped to the arithmetical maximum value for Category B, i.e. 27 years (“medium”). • DC and measures against common cause failures are not relevant in Category B. avg • The electromechanical control system satisfies Category B with a medium MTTF (27 years). This results in an D average probability of dangerous failure of 4.2 · 10–6 per hour. This satisfies PL b.
