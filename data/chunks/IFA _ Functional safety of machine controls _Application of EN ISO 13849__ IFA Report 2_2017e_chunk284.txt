Further safety-related parts of control systems (e.g. safeguards and electrical logic elements) must be added in the form of subsystems for completion of the safety function. 192 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS 1V1 2V1 2V2 2V3 2S1 Functional description • Hazardous movements are controlled redundantly by directional control valves. Movements can be halted either by the directional control valve 1V1 or by the directional control valves 2V2 and 2V3. The latter are driven by the control valve 2V1. • Failure of one of these valves alone does not result in loss of the safety function. • All directional control valves are actuated cyclically in the process. • The functioning of the control valve 2V1 is monitored by means of a pressure switch 2S1.
