receiver transmitter down no-load states on studio hoists Safety function • No-load/slack-cable detection: should a slack cable or suspension element be detected on a studio hoist, the downward movement is stopped (STO – safe torque off). Functional description • Studio hoists driven by electric motors are widely used in studio and stage applications. During downward move- ment, the cable may become slack should the load stick or tilt or come to rest on other objects. In such cases, a risk exists for example of the obstruction suddenly giving way, the load slipping, and danger consequently arising for persons in the hazard zone. • Upward and downward movements of the studio hoist can for example be controlled by means of an infrared remote control. This function is not evaluated here; it must, however, always be implemented with consideration for safety. • In order for the studio hoist to be prevented from falling in the event of breakage of one suspension element, the load is borne by two suspension elements. A slack-cable switch B1/B2 with a break-contact element/make-contact element combination is fitted to each suspension element. • The microcontroller K1 evaluates the switching states of the slack-cable switches B1 and B2. Via logic gates K2/K3 and optocoupled transistor amplifiers K16/K17, K1 also controls the contactor relays K19 and K20 for the upward and downward movements of the studio hoist. • The switching states of the contacts of the slack-cable switches B1 and B2 are evaluated by the microcontroller K1 and tested for plausibility. For testing of the inputs used on the microcontroller, forced dynamics is employed on the signals from the slack-cable switch B1. This involves the microcontroller forcing a temporary signal change via the logic gates K5 and K6, in order to ascertain whether the inputs are still able to transmit
