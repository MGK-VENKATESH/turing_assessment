On 1 Off Signal outputs On 2 Off Reliability of the safety components/devices The failure of safety-related components or devices may lead to disturbances in the machine process and to hazards. These components should therefore offer a high level of reliability. The higher the reliability, the lower the probability of a dangerous failure. The data for reliability describe the number of random failures during the service life of the components. These values are usually specified as: • B value for electromechanical or pneumatic components. Here, service life is determined by switching 10 frequency. The B value
