actuated, the valve locks in the center position. Extending and retracting the cylinder is only possible with the combined actuation of 1V and 2V1, and thus 2V2 and 2V3. The safety-related switching position is achieved by removing the electrical control signal. Failure of one of the valves does not jeopardize the safety function. Further measures are required if captive compressed air presents an additional hazard. Design features 1S1 1S2 Basic and well-tried safety principles 1A1 are met for all relevant components. The directional valves comply with the quiescent current principle and 2V3 2 2V2 2 have sufficient positive overlap. The 2S1 12 12 function of the switching valves 1V1, 1 1 1A1, 2V1, 2V2, and 2V3 is monitored P indirectly. With the help of cylinder switches 1S1 and 1S2, valves 2V3 and 2V2 as well as 1V1 4 2 1V1 are regularly checked in special test cycles. 51 3 2V1 2 13 c Positive IFA rating achieved Emerson expertise| Machine safety 29 A block diagram is created from the circuit diagram Block diagram The components are arranged 1V • In series when the components work together to execute a function. • In parallel “channels” if they perform the function independently (redundant). 2V1 2V2 2V3 • There are monitoring elements in addition to the functional block diagram. 2S 1S1 1S2 Implementing “holding via dual-channel chambering” with AVENTICS products Exhaust modules 4 2 pneumatic 10 4 2 Stop valve G1/8, G1/4 Exhaust modules mechanical 4 2 Shut-off valve Sensor SM6-AL position detection G 1S1 4 2 Ball valve 2 12 V3 2 2 1 V 2 2 2 2S1 with exhaust function 2 1 1 1 3 P Pressure sensor 42 42 PE5 42 42 1V1 4 2 513 2V1 2 13 Valve CD04 Valve CD07 30 Machine safety | Emerson expertise
