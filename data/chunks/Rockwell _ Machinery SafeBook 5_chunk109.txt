DC = 90% PFHDssD = 5.790E-8 dangerous failures per hour. This would be within the range required for SIL3 Effect of the Proof Test Interval IEC/EN 62061 states that a Proof Test Interval (PTI) of 20 years is preferred (but not mandatory) Let us look at the effect the proof test interval has on the system. If we re- calculate the formula with T1 at 20 years it gives the result PFHDssD = 6.58E- 8.It is still within the range required for SIL 3. The designer must keep in mind that this subsystem must be combined with other subsystems to calculate the overall dangerous failure rate. Effect of Common Cause Failure Analysis Let’s look at the effect the common cause failures have on the system. Suppose we take additional measures and our β (Beta) value improves to 1% (0,01), while the proof test interval remains at 20 years. The dangerous failure rate improves to 2.71E-8 which means that the subsystem is now more suitable for use in a SIL 3 system. Common Cause Failure (CCF) Common cause failure is when multiple faults resulting from a single cause produce a dangerous failure. Information on CCF will generally only be required by the subsystem designer, usually the manufacturer. It is used as part of the formulae given for estimation of the PFH of a subsystem. It will not usually be required at the D system design level. Annex F of IEC/EN62061 provides a simple approach for the estimation of CCF.
