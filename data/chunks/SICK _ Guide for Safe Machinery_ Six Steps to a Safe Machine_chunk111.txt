b. The result of the intersection represents the intrusion distance C . Once C and C have been determined, RO RO RT the larger of the two values is used to calculate the minimum distance. b a Figure 87: Parameters for determining the required minimum distance with possibility of reaching over The following applies to the additional distance for reaching over and reaching through: C ≥ C (reaching over) and C ≥ C (reaching through) RO RT On the following pages you will find the table you need for each particular application, as per ISO 13855, and examples of how to use them. 104 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION How to determine the required height of the top edge of the protective field: 1. Determine the height of the hazardous point a and find the equivalent or next highest value in the left-hand column. 2. Calculate the supplement C determined by the resolution using the familiar formulas for perpendicular RT approach: ESPE, resolution d ≤ 40 mm: C = 8 × (d – 14) ° RT ESPE, resolution d > 40 mm: C = 850 mm ° RT 3. In the row defined by a, find the last column in which the shortest additional horizontal distance C is less than or equal to the calculated supplement C determined by the resolution. RT 4. Read the resulting height b of the top edge of the protective field from the bottom row of the column determined in Step 2. Table 42: Determining the required height of the top edge of the protective field according to ISO 13855 Height a of the Additional horizontal distance C to the hazardous area (mm) hazardous area (mm) 2 600 0
