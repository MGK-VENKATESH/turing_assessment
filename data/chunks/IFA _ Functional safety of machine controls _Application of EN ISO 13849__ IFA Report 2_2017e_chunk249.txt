when it drops out. The position switch B2 with make contact is read in by a standard PLC K1, which can bring about the same de-energization response by actua- tion of a second contactor Q1. • The safety function is retained in the event of a component failure. • The switching position of B1 is also read into the PLC K1 by means of a make contact, and is compared for plausibi- lity with the switching position of B2. The switching position of the contactors Q1 and Q2 is likewise monitored in K1 by mirror contacts. Component failures in B1, B2, Q1 and Q2 are detected by K1 and lead to operating inhibition owing to the dropping-out of Q1 and Q2. Faults in the PLC K1 are detected only by the function (fault detection by the process). 160 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS B1 Q2 B2 K1 Q1 Design features • Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. Protective circuits (such as contact protection) as described in the initial paragraphs of Chapter 8 are implemented. • A stable arrangement of the guard is assured for actuation of the position switch. • B1 is a position switch with a dirct opening contact in accordance with IEC 60947-5-1, Annex K. • The supply conductors to the position switches are laid separately or with protection. • Faults in the actuating and operating mechanism are detected by the use of two position switches differing in the principle of their operation (break and make contacts). • Q1 and Q2 possess mirror contacts in accordance with IEC 60947-4-1, Annex F. The PLC K1 satisfies the normative requirements described in subclause 6.3. Calculation of the probability of failure • MTTF : the position switch B1 with roller actuation exhibits
