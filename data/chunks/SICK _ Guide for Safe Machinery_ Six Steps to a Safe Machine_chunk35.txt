2 SAFE DESIGN (INHERENTLY SAFE DESIGN) In the case of applications in normally dry rooms, it is not necessary to provide protection against direct contact (basic protection) if the rms value of the AC voltage does not exceed 25 V or the harmonic-free DC voltage does not exceed 60 V. A harmonic-free state exists when the DC voltage is superimposed with a sinusoidal AC voltage component of no more than 10% effective. The safety extra-low voltage circuit shall be safely separated from other circuits (adequate air and creepage distances, insulation, connection of circuits to the protective conductor, etc.). Two safety extra-low voltages are distinguished: • SELV (safety extra-low voltage) • PELV (protective extra-low voltage) NOTE A safety extra-low voltage shall not be generated from the mains using autotransformers, voltage dividers, or series resistors.
