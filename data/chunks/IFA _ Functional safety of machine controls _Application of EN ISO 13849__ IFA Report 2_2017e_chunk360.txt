They also serve to retain the equivalence to the MTTF = 1 (D.1) other parameters (five Categories, four DC levels), and to D λ D provide the necessary simplification for presentation in the bar chart. At a constant failure rate, the MTTF is therefore equiva- D lent to statement of a failure rate, whilst being much more Table D.1: illustrative. Whereas the practical significance of an FIT Division into classes of the MTTF for channels which execute D value is not very illustrative, statement of an anticipated the safety function time in years conveys the quality of components more Description of the MTTF Range of the MTTF graphically.
