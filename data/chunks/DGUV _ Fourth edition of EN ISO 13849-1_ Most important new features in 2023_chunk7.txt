composed of subsystem elements under EN ISO 13849. The relevant design requirements for subsystems are dealt with in the next section of the standard. 6 Section 6: Design considerations and Annex K The new section 6 now provides not only a description of categories and combinations of subsystems, but all the properties and parameters that were previously mentioned to some extent in subsections 4.4 and 4.5 and which help to define the achieved PL. After a general introduction, the first focus is on the correlation between PL and SIL. Referring to subsystems developed under IEC 61508 and IEC 62061, the standard only deals with the integration of those intended for use under high demand or continuous mode of operation and dsigned according to Route 1 (see IEC 61508-2:2011, 7.4.42). H 6.1 Subsection 6.1.3: Categories When describing categories, a number of important details have changed or have been given a clearer emphasis: • Category assignment at the subsystem level (6.1.3.1) A neat distinction between SRP/CS and subsystems must involve the assignment of a category to each subsystem developed under EN ISO 13849. It follows that an SRP/CS may also include subsystems of different categories and subsystems with SIL classifications. • Proven Category 1 components (6.1.3.2.3) Whilst the content of Category 1 requirements has not changed much, the description for well-tried components has now been moved to a separate subsection 6.1.11, where direct reference is made to the well-tried components listed in EN ISO 13849-2 for various technologies and where informative reference is made to the concept of “proven in use”, as defined in IEC 61508. It is now part of the standard (and no longer a comment) that complex components are unsuitable as well- tried components. • Testing in Category 2 (6.1.3.2.4) In the future, the main feature of Category 2
