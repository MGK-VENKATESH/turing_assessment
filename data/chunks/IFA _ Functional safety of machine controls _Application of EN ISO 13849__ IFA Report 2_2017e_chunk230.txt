the signal change. Forced dynamics of the signals of one slack-cable switch is sufficient. 140 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS B1 K10 K6 K1 K2 K16 K3 K17 K19 K20 K22 B2 K11 K12 K9 K5 K7 K8 K4 K18 K13 K14 K15 K21 • Self-tests of the integrated units such as the ALU, RAM and ROM are performed in the microcontroller K1. The vol- tage monitor K7 monitors the supply voltage generated by means of K22. Faults in the microcontroller are detected by temporal monitoring of the program sequence in the watchdog K8. The components K19 to K21 for control of the studio hoist‘s upward and and downward movements are monitored by means of readback – decoupled by optocouplers K13 to K15 – in the microcontroller. Should a fault be detected, the studio hoist is shut off at a higher level by the component detecting the fault via the contactor relay K21, actuated by logic gate K4 and decoupled by optocoupler K18. If the watchdog K8 is not retriggered in time by the microcontroller K1, the movement of the studio hoist is stopped from K8 via all logic gates K2 to K4. Design features • Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. Protective circuits as described in the initial paragraphs of Chapter 8 are implemented. • A slack cable is detected redundantly for both suspension elements via the two slack-cable switches B1 and B2. These switches contain position switches with direct opening action in accordance with IEC 60947-5-1, Annex K. • A stable arrangement is assured for the operating mechanism of the slack-cable switches. • K19 to K21 possess mechanically linked contact elements to IEC 60947-5-1, Annex L. • The software (SRESW) for K1 is programmed in accordance with the requirements
