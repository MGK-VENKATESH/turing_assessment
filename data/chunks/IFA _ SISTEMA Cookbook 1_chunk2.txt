for the machine design engineer to calculate the probability of a dan- gerous failure per hour (PFH) in order to determine the Performance Level (PL). The Per- formance Level is dependent upon the control system's structure (Category), as well as the systematic requirements. For this purpose, the IFA provides the SISTEMA software tool (the German acronym stands for "safety of controls on machines‚Äù), which can be downloaded free of charge from www.dguv.de/ifa, Webcode e34183. Before beginning the calculations, the machine design engineer must produce a safety- related block diagram for each safety function from the circuit diagram. The safety-related block diagram must show the implementation of the safety function in functional channels (including redundant channels, where present) and testing components, also where present. The SISTEMA Cookbook 1 addresses this unfamiliar and difficult abstraction step (Figure 1) and the subsequent step, that of transferring the blocks to SISTEMA and entering their pa- rameters.

A precise definition of the safety function (see BGIA Report 2/2008, Chapter 5) is therefore indispensable for the subsequent steps. The schematic circuit diagram showing the relevant components is produced for each safety function. The relevant components include all those of which the failure may impair execution of
