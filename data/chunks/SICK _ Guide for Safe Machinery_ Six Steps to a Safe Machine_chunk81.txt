Horizontally arranged safety light curtains (AOPDs) are used for this application. Each of their light beams can be evaluated to distinguish the interruption pattern of the material or material carrier (e.g., pallet) from that of a person. By using self-teaching dynamic blanking, as well as other differentiation criteria such as direction of move‐ ment, speed, entry and exit in the protective field, etc., a safety-relevant distinction can be made. In this way, undetected entry into the hazardous area by anyone can be reliably prevented (see figure 60). Figure 60: Entry/exit function with horizontally installed safety light curtain in a processing station on an automobile assem‐ bly line Safety laser scanner with protective field switching Another way of moving material into a protected area is to actively switch protective fields. As an alternative to active protective field switching, it is possible to sep‐ arately evaluate simultaneous protective fields. Safety laser scanners with vertical (or slightly tilted) protective fields are generally used for this application. The appropriate protective field, from a series of pre‐ programmed protective fields, is activated by corre‐ sponding signals from the machine controller and ade‐ quately positioned sensors. The contour of the protec‐ tive field is designed such that passage of the
