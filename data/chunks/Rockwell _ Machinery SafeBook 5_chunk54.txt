a scheduled basis. The risk assessment will help determine whether the input devices need to be checked and how often they should be checked. The higher the level of risk, the greater integrity required of the checking process. And the less frequent the “automatic” checking, the more frequent should be the imposed “manual” check. Input Cross-fault Detection In dual channel systems, channel-to-channel short circuit faults of the input devices, also known as cross-faults, must be detected by the safety system. This is accomplished by the sensing device or the monitoring safety relay. Microprocessor based monitoring safety relays, like light curtains, laser scanners and advanced non-contact sensors detect these shorts in a variety of ways. One common way of detecting cross-faults is by using pulse testing. The signals input to the MSR are pulsed very quickly. The channel 1 pulse is offset from the channel 2 pulse. If a short occurs, the pulses occur concurrently and are detected by the device. Electro-mechanical based monitoring safety relays employ a different diversity technique: one pull-up input and one pull-down input. A short from Channel 1 to Channel 2 will make the overcurrent protection device active and the safety system will shut down. Outputs MSRs come with various numbers of outputs. The types of outputs help determine which MSR must be used in specifi c applications. Most MSRs have at least 2 immediately operating safety outputs. MSR safety outputs are characterized as normally-open. These are safety rated due to the redundancy and internal checking. A second type of output is delayed outputs. Delayed-off outputs are typically used in Category 1 stops, where the machine requires time to execute the stopping function before allowing access to the hazard area. MSRs also have auxiliary outputs. Generally these are considered normally closed. Output Ratings Output ratings describe
