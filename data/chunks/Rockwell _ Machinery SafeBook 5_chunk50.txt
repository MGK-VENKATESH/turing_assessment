to the hazard, as other personnel may not be protected. ISO 13851 (EN574) provides additional guidance on two-hand control. Enabling Devices Enabling devices are controls that are sometimes part of a permissive strategy to allow an operator to enter a hazard area with the hazard motor running at safe speed and only while the operator is holding the enabling device in the actuated position. Enabling devices use either two-position or three position types of switches. Two position types are off when the actuator is not operated, and are on when the actuator is operated. Three position switches are off when not actuated (position 1), on when held in the centre position (position 2) and off when the actuator is operated past the mid position (position 3). In addition, when returning from position 3 to 1, the output circuit must not close when passing through position 2. Enabling devices must be used in conjunction with other safety related functions. A typical example is placing the motion is in a controlled safe slow mode. When using an enabling device, a signal must indicate that the enabling device is active. Logic Devices Logic devices play the central role of the safety related part of the control system. Logic devices perform the checking and monitoring of the safety system and either allow the machine to start or execute commands to stop the machine. A range of logic devices are available to create a safety architecture that meets the complexity and the functionality required for the machine. Small hardwired monitoring safety relays are most economical for smaller machines where a dedicated logic device is needed to complete the safety function. Modular and confi gurable monitoring safety relays are preferred where a large and diverse number of safeguarding devices and minimal zone control are required. The
