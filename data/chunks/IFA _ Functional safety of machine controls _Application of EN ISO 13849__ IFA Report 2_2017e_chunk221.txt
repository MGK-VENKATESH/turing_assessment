frequency inverter has an MTTF of 35 years [M]. The capacitor D D D C1 is included in the calculation with an MTTF of 45,662 years [D]. At a B value of 5,000,000 cycles [M] and a rate D 10D of operations of daily energization on 240 working days, the result is an MTTF of 208,333 years for K1 and K2. At a D B value of 2,000,000 cycles [M] and at 240 working days, 16 working hours and a cycle time of 3 minutes, the n 10D op is 76,800 cycles per year and the MTTF 260 years for K3. At a B value of 600,000 cycles [M] and at 240 working D 10D days, 16 working hours and a cycle time of 3 minutes, the n is 76,800 cycles per year and the MTTF 7.8 years for op D Q1. These values produce a symmetrized MTTF for the channel of 60 years (“high”). D • DC : an adequate test rate of the emergency-stop devices is assured (refer to the information in subclauses 6.2.14 avg and D.2.5.1). Fault detection of the blocks S3.1 and S3.2 is achieved by cross monitoring in K4 (DC = 90%). Fault detection by the process in the event of failure of actuation of the deceleration ramp leads to a DC of 60% for K5. For T1, the DC is 60%, likewise as a result of fault detection by the process. K1 and K2 exhibit a DC of 99% owing to the integral fault detection in K4. For K3, the DC is 99% owing to fault detection by K5. For C1, the DC is 60% owing to testing in the PLC of the timing element with the FI shut-off by way of the drop-out time of the contactor relay K3. For Q1, the DC
