A detailed description of each step is beyond the scope of this document. Knowledge of the Connected Components Workbench software is assumed. Confi gure the 440C-CR30 Relay Follow these steps to confi gure the Guardmaster 440C-CR30 relay in Connected Components Workbench software. 1. In Connected Components Workbench software, choose View and then Device Toolbox. When in Device Toolbox, select 440C-CR30-22BBB. 2. In the Project Organizer, double-click Guardmaster_400C_CR30 *. 113 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery 3. To add the plug-in I/O module called for in this circuit, right-click the left plug-in module space and choose the 2080-IQ4OB4 module. TIP: The I/O module is shown in standard gray, because it is not a safety I/O module. That is permissible in this application, because it is not used to connect safety signals. Inputs such as Feedback and Reset button are not considered strict, safety signals. Using the standard I/O for these non-safety signals can reserve the limited number of safety inputs and outputs for true safety signals. 4. Click the Edit Logic button to open the Connected Components Workbench workspace. A blank workspace appears. 114 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Application Examples 5. From the View pull-down menu, choose Toolbox. The Toolbox appears. Confi gure the Inputs The Toolbox does not list a SensaGuard Safety Monitoring Function. Follow these steps to confi gure one. 1.Select Alternative Device. Drag it to the green
