time to dangerous failure (MTTF ), and average diagnostic coverage (DC ) can be registered step by step for D avg individual components or blocks. The effect of each parameter change on the entire system is displayed directly and can be printed as a report. Developed by the German Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, SISTEMA has established itself as a standard. The tool is available as a free download at www.dguv.de. From there you can also access the AVENTICS libraries, where you can directly incorporate all relevant products in your calculation.
