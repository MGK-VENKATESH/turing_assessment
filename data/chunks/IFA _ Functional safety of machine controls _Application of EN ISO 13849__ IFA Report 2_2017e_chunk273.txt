start-up of the door‘s revolving movement for the first time, start-up tests are performed. The tests include, for example, tests of the microcontroller blocks (microprocessor, random-access and read-only memory), input and output tests, and checking of driving of the motor by the frequency inverter (including testing of the fast stop func- tion and of STO1/STO2). A brake test is also performed, in which the frequency inverter is required to act against the applied brake. • During comparison of data between the two controllers, desired values and intermediate results are exchanged, with inclusion of the cyclical self-tests. • Owing to the use of a frequency inverter with STO, a contactor is no longer required for disconnection of the supply voltage. The frequency inverter is suitable for driving and braking. 183 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS • K3 possesses mechanically linked contact elements to IEC 60947-5-1, Annex L. The switching position of the break- contact element is monitored by the microcontroller K2 for the purpose of fault detection. • It is assumed in the example that closed-loop control provided by the frequency inverter T1 is sufficient for braking of the revolving door. Once a standstill has been reached, STO is activated in order to prevent unexpected start- up. The braking time and braking distance are monitored by the controller (ramp monitoring). The brake Q1 in the second channel is required so that, should T1 no longer be able to perform the fast stop T1s following the occur- rence of a fault, no danger can arise owing to an unexpected movement. Q1 operates on the closed-circuit current principle. • The software (SRESW) in K1 and K2 is programmed in accordance with the requirements for PL d as per subclause 6.3. • The standard components G1 and G2 (where relevant for the rotary encoders)
