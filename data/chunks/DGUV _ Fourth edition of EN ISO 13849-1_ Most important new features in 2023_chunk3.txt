13849-2 has been completed. At the same time, it can be assumed that they will be met as soon as the validation requirements from part 2 have been implemented. Fourth Edition of EN ISO 13849-1 (July 2023) 2 / 12 2 Section 1: Scope As in the previous edition, the authors point out that the standard only applies to SRP/CS for a high demand or continuous mode of operation. According to definition 3.1.44, the demand for this mode is more frequent than once a year. For SRP/CS in low demand mode, i.e. where the frequency is less than once a year – for instance in the processing industry – the authors now refer expressly to the IEC 61508 series of standards. IT security aspects are not covered by the standard, but the authors point out that the such aspects can also impact safety functions. For further details, reference is given to ISO/TR 22100-2 [3] and IEC/TR 63074 [4]. 3 Section 3: Terms, definitions, symbols and abbreviated terms The revised standard contains a large number of new definitions, whereas some of the previous definitions have been dropped. Nearly all existing definitions have been renumbered. It should be emphasised, in particular, that the previous “probability of dangerous failure per hour” is now referred to as “average frequency of a dangerous failure per hour”. Its abbreviation has been changed back to PFH (without the “D” index), to ensure that it has the same name as in the IEC standards on functional safety. This does not result in technical changes. 4 Section 4: Overview To meet the stated aim of an improved structure, this section starts first with items from the previous section 4 “Design Aspects” on embedding in the iterative process of risk assessment and risk reduction as specified in EN ISO 12100.
