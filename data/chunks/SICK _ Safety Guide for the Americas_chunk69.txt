account during the Human aspects 2 preparation of the safety concept: The following human aspects should be taken into account: • Features of the machine • Expected qualification of the machine operator • Features of the surroundings • Expected number of people in the area • Human aspects • Approach speed (K) • Features of the design • Possibility of defeating the protective devices 3 • Characteristics of safeguarding (g3-17) • Foreseeable misuse Which protective devices are to be selected and how they are to Features of the design c be integrated must be defined based on the above features.

A safety account: function is performed by several subsystems. • Ability to stop the dangerous movement at any time (if not It is often not possible to implement a subsystem using only possible, use guards or impeding devices) certified safety components that readily provide the level of • Ability to stop the dangerous movement without additional safety (PL/SIL). In fact, the subsystem frequently has to be hazards (if not possible, select different design/protective assembled from a number of discrete elements. In such cases, device) the level of safety is dependent on various parameters. • Possibility of hazard due to ejected parts (if yes: use guards) • Stopping times (knowledge of stopping times is necessary to ensure the protective device is effective) • Possibility of monitoring stop time/overrun (this is necessary if changes could occur due to aging/wear) Features of the surroundings The following features of the surroundings should be taken into account: • Electromagnetic disturbances, radiated interference • Vibration, shock •
