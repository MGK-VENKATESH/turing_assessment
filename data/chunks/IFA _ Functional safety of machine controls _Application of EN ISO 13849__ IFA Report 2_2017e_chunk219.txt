status is first queried by the PLC K5 via the input I0, and the FI is shut down by resetting of the PLC output O2. Redundantly to this process, the contactor relay K3 is shut-off – with drop-out delay provided by the capacitor C1 – and following timeout of the set braking time, the activation signal to the mains contactor Q1 is interrupted. • In the event of failure of the PLC K5, the frequency inverter T1, the mains contactor Q1, the contactor relays K1/ K2 or the contactor relay with drop-out delay K3, stopping of the drive is nevertheless assured, since two shut-off paths independent of each other are always present. Failure of the contactor relays K1 and K2 to drop out is detec- ted – at the latest following resetting of the actuated emergency stop device – by monitoring of the mechanically linked break contacts within the emergency stop safety module K4. Failure of the contactor relay K3 to drop out is detected – at the latest before renewed start-up of the machine movement – through feedback of the mechanically linked break contact to the PLC input I3. Failure of the mains contactor Q1 to drop out is detected by the mirror con- tact read in on the PLC input I3. Welding of this mirror contact is detected by the mechanically linked auxiliary make contact on the PLC input I2. In the event of a fault in the capacitor C1, the measured drop-out time of the contactor relay K3 differs from the time specified in the PLC. The fault is detected and leads to the machine being shut down and to operating inhibition of the machine. Organizational measures ensure that each emergency-stop device is actuated at least once a year. Design features • Basic and well-tried safety principles
