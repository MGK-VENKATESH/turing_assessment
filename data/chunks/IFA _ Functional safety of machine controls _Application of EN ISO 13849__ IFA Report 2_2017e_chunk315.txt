and environmental conditions (25 + 10) • For Category 4, the average probability of dangerous failure is 6.5 · 10-8 per hour. This satisfies PL e. • With allowance for the estimation erring on the safe side described above, a value of over 17 years (T ) is pro- 10D duced for the specified replacement of the wearing elements S1 and S2. 238 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS More detailed references • EN 1010-3: Safety of machinery – Safety requirements for the design and construction of printing and paper conver- ting machines – Part 3: Cutting machines (2002) + A1 (2009) • EN 574: Safety of machinery – Two-hand control devices – Functional aspects – Principles for design (1996) +A1 (2008) • IEC 60947-5-1: Low-voltage switchgear and controlgear – Part 5-1: Control circuit devices and switching elements – Electromechanical control circuit devices (2009) + A1 (2012).

Further SRP/CS (e.g. safeguards and electrical logic elements) must be added in the form of subsystems for completion of the safety function. Functional description • Hazardous movements are executed by four actuators, 1A to 4A. The movements are halted
