contactors with positively guided contacts, it is possible to design control functions with any level of complexity. Redundancy and monitoring by positively guided contacts are features of this safety principle. Wiring provides the logical operators. Function: If the contactors K1 and K2 are de-energized, on pressing S1 the K3 contactor is energized and remains energized. If no object is detected in the active protective field, the outputs OSSD1 and OSSD2 are conducting voltage. The contactors K1 and K2 are energized by the normally open contacts on K3 and latch. K3 is de-energized by releasing S1. Only then are the output circuits closed. On detection of an object in the active protective field, the K1 and K2 contactors are de-energized by the OSSD1 and OSSD2 outputs.

They generally also have automatic monitoring functions. The cut-off paths can be set up based on contact or using semiconductors. They can also have signaling contacts. Building more complex safety applications is simplified by integrating multiple functions into one device. The certified safety relay also reduces the time and effort involved in validating the safety functions. In safety relays, semiconductor elements can perform the task of the electromechanical switching elements instead of relays. Using measures to detect faults such as the sampling of dynamic signals or
