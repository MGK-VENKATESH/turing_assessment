with a vertically mounted light curtain as the trip device. Interlocked guard doors may also be regarded as a trip only device when there is nothing to prevent the door being closed after entry. If whole body access is not possible, so a person is not able to continue past the tripping point, their presence is always detected and the second point (preventing switching on) is achieved. For partial body applications, the same types of devices perform tripping and presence sensing. The only difference being the type of application. Presence sensing devices are used to detect the presence of people. The family of devices includes safety light curtains, single beam safety barriers, safety laser scanners and safety mats. For all presence sensing devices the size of the detection zone and the positioning of the device must take the required safety distance into account. Safety Light Curtains Safety light curtains are most simply described as photoelectric presence sensors specifi cally designed to protect personnel from injuries related to hazardous machine motion. Also known as AOPDs (Active Opto-electronic Protective Devices) or ESPE (Electro Sensitive Protective Equipment), light curtains offer optimal safety, yet they can allow for greater productivity. They are ideally suited for applications where personnel need frequent and easy access to a point of operation hazard. Light curtains are designed and tested to meet IEC 61496-1 and -2. Safety Laser Scanners Safety laser scanners use a rotating mirror that defl ects light pulses over an arc, creating a plane of detection. The location of the object is determined by the angle of rotation of the mirror. Using a “time-of-fl ight” technique of a refl ected beam of invisible light, the scanner can also detect the distance the object is from the 36 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Implementation of Protective Measures scanner.
