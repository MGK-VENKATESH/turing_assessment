the lowest PL (low) is “e”. • The number of subsystems with this PL is 3 (i.e., ≤ 3). Therefore, the overall PL achieved is “e”. • According to this method, adding another subsystem with a PL of “e” would reduce the overall PL to “d”. 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 131 Subject to change without notice Example 2: • One subsystem achieves PL “d”, two subsystems achieve PL “c”. The lowest PL (low) is, therefore, “c”. • The number of subsystems with this PL is 2 (i.e. ≤ 2). Therefore, the overall PL achieved is “c”. This method is based on mean values within the PFH value ranges for the different PLs. Therefore, using the D detailed method (see next section) may deliver more accurate results. NOTE - If the PL is not known for all subsystems, their safety level can be determined (see "Determining the safety level of a subsystem", page 132). Detailed procedure according to ISO 13849-1 An essential – but not exclusive – criterion for determining the PL is the “probability of a dangerous failure per hour (PFH )” of the safety components. The resulting PFH value is the sum of the individual PFH values. D D D Determining the safety level of a subsystem If the PFH value is not known for all subsystems, then their safety level can be determined. Subsystems can D consist of several components, even from different manufacturers. Examples of components in subsystems: • Input side: 2 safety switches on a physical guard • Output side: 1 contactor and 1 frequency inverter to stop a dangerous movement For these subsystems with multiple components, the PL must be determined separately. The performance level achieved for a subsystem is made up of the following parameters: • Structure and
