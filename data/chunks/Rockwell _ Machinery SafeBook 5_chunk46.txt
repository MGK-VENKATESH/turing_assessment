may be dropped by machine holding fi xtures, which require power to hold the material. Mechanical stopping means (brakes), not requiring power, may also be a used with a category 0 stop. The category 0 stop takes priority over category 1 or category 2 stops. Category 1 is a controlled stop with power available to the machine actuators to achieve the stop. Power is then removed from the actuators when the stop is achieved. This category of stop allows powered braking to quickly stop hazardous motion, and then power can be removed from the actuators. This type of stop may result in a faster and more controlled stop from which a restart can be quicker. NOTE: The 2016 Edition of IEC/EN 60204-1 will expand the types of Category 1 stop. Category 2 is a controlled stop with power left available to the machine actuators. A normal production stop is considered a category 2 stop. These stop categories must be applied to each stop function, where the stop function is the action taken by the safety related parts of the control system in response to an input, category 0 or 1 should be used. Stop functions must override related start functions. The selection of the stop category for each stop function must be determined by a risk assessment. Emergency Stop Function The emergency stop function must operate as either a category 0 or category 1 stop, as determined by a risk assessment. It must be initiated by a single human action. When executed, it must override all other functions and machine operating modes. The objective is to remove power as quickly as possible without creating additional hazards. Wherever there is a danger of an operator getting into trouble on a machine there must be a facility for fast access to an
