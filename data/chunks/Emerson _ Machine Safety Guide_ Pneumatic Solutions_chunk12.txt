million switching op 10 cycles results in an MTTF value of 391.41 years; D For channel 2 with the following operating data: 220 d/a, 16 h/d, T = 3.600 s -> n = 3.520 cycles/year and a B value for the CD04 directional valve of 32 million switching cycles as op 10 well as a B value of 2 million switching cycles for the LU6 locking unit results in an MTTF value of 181.818 years for the valve and 10D D 5.682 years for the locking unit. Both channels therefore have a high MTTF value. D 18 Machine safety | Basic conditions Identification of the MTTF using the value B – example D 10 for lifecycle duration The value B specifies the number of cycles until 10% 10 of components tested in endurance trials (acc. to DIN EN ISO 19973) have exceeded the defined limits. B 10 describes a statistical failure probability. It is an indicator for the reliability of a wearing part, evaluating the number of switching cycles for pneumatic valves, for example. In terms of machine safety, ISO 13849-1 only considers dangerous machine failures. These are described by B . 10D Assuming that half of all failures are dangerous, we would apply the formula B = 2 x B . B is required for all 10D 10 10D safety-related components in a control that are susceptible to wear and for all components directly involved in a safety function. The value for B is used to calculate MTTF (see 10D D page 19). Emerson provides extensive proof of reliability for its products in order to calculate performance levels.
