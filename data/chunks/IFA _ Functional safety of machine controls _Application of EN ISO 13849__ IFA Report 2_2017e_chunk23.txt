Report 2/2008e): The changes between the second and third editions of the standard, and its future development, are discussed at • References updated the end of the chapter. • New subclause 4.4 concerning changes arising from 4.1 Identification of safety functions and the third edition of the standard, 2015 their properties • Subclause 4.5 (formerly 4.4) concerning future deve- The design and assessment process begins with a well- lopment of the standard updated tried concept, that of the definition of one or more safety functions (SFs). The procedure is shown in Figure 4.1 by blocks 1 to 3, and is described in greater detail in Chap- This chapter cross-references the further chapters and ter 5. The question to be answered is: in what way do annexes of this report to the standard.
