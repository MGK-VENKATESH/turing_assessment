of the function is not enabled • Position 2, actuated in middle position Execution of the function is enabled • Position 3, actuated beyond the middle position Execution of the function is not enabled and it must stop immediately. Depending on the applica‐ tion, the triggering of a safety-related stop func‐ tion or an emergency stop function may also be required. During machine setup and maintenance, and if it is necessary to observe production processes close up, the functions of the protective devices intended for normal operation can be temporarily disabled using Figure 69: Enabling device for setting up an automatic drilling machine enabling devices. This is only permissible, however, in conjunction with other measures that minimize the risk (reduced force or speed, etc.). NOTICE The machine start shall not be initiated solely by the actuation of an enabling device. Instead, movement is only permitted as long as the enabling device is actuated. The enabling device function must not be released while changing back from position 3 to position 2. If enabling devices are equipped with separate contacts in position 3, it is recommended to integrate them into a safety-related stop function or the emergency stop function. Protection against manipulation shall be considered when using enabling devices. NOTE - Requirements on enabling devices: IEC 60204-1 Foot switches Foot switches are used to control work processes. On certain machines (e.g., on presses, punches, bending and sheet metal working machines), foot switches may only be used in safety functions under the following conditions: • only for special operating modes • always in conjunction with other technical protective measures (e.g., slow speed of a dangerous movement) Foot switches used in this way must be designed as follows: • A protective cover to protect against unintentional actuation • A 3-position design similar to the
