restart if the g AOPD is interrupted within a dangerous movement • To initiate a restart after more than 30 s has elapsed (see IEC 61496-1/ RIA TR R15.406, CSA Z432, EN 61496-1) g More information: EN 692 However, it is necessary to check that no hazard to the operator can arise during the work process. This limits use to small machines where the hazard zone can- not be accessed and presence detection is in place. Suitable measures must also be taken to protect all other sides of the machine. If this operating mode is activated, the resolution of the AOPD must be less than or equal to 30 mm (see ANSI B11.19, CSA Z432, ISO 13855, RIA TR R15.406, EN 692, and EN 693). As a general rule, when mounting protective devices, the following faults must be excluded: reaching over, reaching under, reaching around, standing behind. SRECS Safety-related electrical control Electrical control system for a machine the failure of which will result in an im- system mediate increase in the risk or risks.
