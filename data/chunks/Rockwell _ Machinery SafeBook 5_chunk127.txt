These outputs control the 100S-C contactors. The 440C-CR30 relay turns off its outputs and removes power to the motor when a fault is detected. It does not reset until that fault is corrected.

Hazardous motion is ceased or prevented whenever this door is not closed. In addition to monitoring the state of the guarded door, the SensaGuard switch monitors its outputs for all fault conditions. The 440C-CR30 confi gurable safety relay also detects an open-wire fault, a single-channel fault, or a short to 0V at its SensaGuard switch inputs. 111 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery The 440C-CR30 confi gurable safety relay monitors the pulse-tested outputs that drive the safety contactor coils for all fault conditions. The proper, safe state of the safety contactors, K1 and K2, is confi rmed by the 440C-CR30 confi gurable safety relay that is monitoring the feedback signals at SMF2 at start-up. 24V DC - Class 2 DC COM 440C-CR30-22BBB A1 A2 Bn Rd Yel 440C- CR30 Access 100S-C23EJ23BC* Door Gy EI_00 EO_18 K1 Pk 440N-Z21U16A EI_01
