The following is a brief overview: This standard provides requirements for the design and integration of safety-related parts of control systems, including some software aspects. The standard applies to a safety-related system but can also be applied to the component parts of the system. SISTEMA Software PL Calculation Tool SISTEMA is a software tool for the implementation of (EN) ISO 13849-1. Its use will greatly simplify the quantifi cation and calculation aspects of the implementation of the standard. SISTEMA stands for “Safety Integrity Software Tool for the Evaluation of Machine Applications” and is regularly reviewed and updated by IFA. It requires the input of various types of functional safety data as described later in this section. The data can be input manually or automatically by using a manufacturer’s SISTEMA Data Library. The Rockwell Automation SISTEMA Data Library is available for download, together with a link to the SISTEMA download site, at: www.rockwellautomation.com, under Solutions & Services > Safety Solutions. Overview of (EN) ISO 13849-1 The following general overview is intended to provide an overview of the basic provisions of (EN) ISO 13849-1. It also includes some mention of its revision published early in 2106. It is essential that the standard itself is studied in full detail. This standard has wide applicability, as it applies to all technologies, including electrical, hydraulic, pneumatic
