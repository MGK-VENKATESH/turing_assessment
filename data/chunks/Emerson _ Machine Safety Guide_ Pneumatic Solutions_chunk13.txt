dangerous failure does occur, despite all application. The possibility of excluding a failure also depends on preventive measures, test equipment (diagnostics the application. or monitoring system) can detect it at an early This decision is therefore not usually made by the component stage to return the machine to a safe state. DC values are classified as follows: Depending on the required performance level, Designation DC range there are requirements for the DC or diagnostic coverage value, i.e. the coverage which must be None DC < 60 % provided by testing equipment. Low 60 % ≤ DC < 90 % The performance level therefore includes the Medium 90 % ≤ DC < 99 % High 99 % ≤ DC Diagnostic options for pneumatics c Four DC classes in the simplified approach from ISO 13849-1 Plausibility check manufacturer. Cylinder switch Annex E of ISO 13849-1 provides a simplified approach to Position measuring system estimating DC values. The engineer analyzes and evaluates the switching and the sequence of machine processes to estimate the percentage of errors that can be discovered by these measures. G G G Typical errors for safety-related parts of control systems are P P Pressure listed in ISO 13849-2. A typical error that could occur with sensor directional valves is failure to lock, for example. Diagnosis occurs SPS Flow meter indirectly via the sensor at the cylinder; here, a diagnostic coverage level of 90% can be assumed. For the locking unit, a typical error might be “Failing to clamp although control input is Switching position vented”. Diagnosis is performed in this case directly by the sensor sensing 4 2 at the locking unit. For this component, diagnostic coverage 14 Switching of 99% can be assumed. Average diagnostic coverage can be position 5 1 3 calculated using the formula: sensing DC
