linked contact elements. The averaging formula returns a result of 61% (“low”) for DC . avg • Adequate measures against common cause failure (85 points): separation (15), diversity (20), overvoltage protec- tion etc. (15) and environmental conditions (25 + 10) • The combination of the control elements in the “light barriers” subsystem satisfies Category 2 with a high MTTF D of the functional channel (32 years) and low DC (61%). This results in an average probability of dangerous failure avg PFH of 1.9 · 10-6 per hour. D The following assumptions are made for the “main contactor relay” subsystem: • B = 1,300,000 cycles [S] with an n of 76,800 cycles per year. This leads to an MTTF of 169 years, which in 10D op D accordance with the standard is capped to 100 years. The structure satisfies Category 1; DC and common cause avg failures are not therefore relevant. The resulting average probability of dangerous failure is 1.1 · 10-6 per hour. • Addition of the average probabilities of dangerous failure of the two subsystems results in a PFH of 3.0 · 10-6 per D hour. This satisfies PL c. • If it is anticipated that a demand will be made upon the safety function more frequently than assumed for the Cate- gory 2 designated architecture (the ratio is lower than 100:1, i.e. more frequently than once every 5 hours), this can be allowed for accordance with Annex K, Note 1 of the standard by an additional penalty of 10% down to a ratio of 25:1. In the case with three light barriers under consideration here, the “light barriers” subsystem still attains a PFH of 2.1 · 10-6 per hour. The average probability of dangerous failure PFH of 3.2 · 10-6 per hour only attains PL b, D D
