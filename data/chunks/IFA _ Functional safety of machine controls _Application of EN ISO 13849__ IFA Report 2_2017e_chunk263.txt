employed. This PLC‘s probability of failure of 1.5 · 10-7 per hour [E] is added at the end of the calculation for the sensor/actuator subsystem. For the composition of the block diagram, refer also to Figure 6.14 and the relevant information in the associated text. The probability of failure for the sensor/actuator subsystem is calculated below. • MTTF : at 240 working days, 8 working hours and a cycle time of one hour, n is 1,920 cycles per year. A B value D op 10D of 20,000,000 cycles [S] is assumed for the position switch B1 owing to its direct opening action; the associated MTTF value is 104,166.7 years. Owing to the defined control current (low load; the mechanical durability of the con- D tacts is the determining factor), a B value of 100,000 cycles [E] is assumed for the make-contact element, which 10D is opened by spring force (see also Table D.2), and therefore an MTTF of 520 years. The contactor Q1, with a B D 10D value of 400,000 cycles, switches operationally only once daily, equating to an n of 240 cycles per year and an op MTTF of 16,667 years. The following manufacturer‘s values are available: an MTTF of 100 years for T1 and an MTTF D D D of 190 years for G1/G2 [M]. These values yield a symmetrized MTTF of each channel of 84 years (“high”). D • DC : a DC of 99% is assumed for each of the components used. For the position switches and the rotary encoders, avg this value is based upon cross monitoring of input signals in K1. For the frequency inverter T1, the speed is moni- tored in the safety PLC via the two rotary encoders, and fault detection is provided by the process; the main contac- tor relay
