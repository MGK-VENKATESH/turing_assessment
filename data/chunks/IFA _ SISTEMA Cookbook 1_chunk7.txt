in accordance with IEC standards), PFH and Category (internal structure). The internal structure of the encapsulated subsystem need not be deconstructed further. Note: If a Category 3 or 4 encapsulated subsystem occupies in both redundant functional channels, both functional channels pass through it. Step 4: Can all component faults be excluded? All assumed faults for the component in the block under analysis are considered in turn. For this purpose, the annex of EN ISO 13849-2 contains the fault models of a number of compo- nents used in machine controls. Owing to justified fault exclusions, certain component faults can be discounted. For each fault case, it must be considered whether the intended safety- related functionality of the component is retained (harmless fault) or fails (dangerous fault). A dangerous fault exists for example for contactor Q2 in Example 1 (Figure 3) when the safety door is opened but Q2 fails to drop out because its contacts have welded. Should no dangerous faults whatsoever need to be assumed for the component, no value exists for calculation of the PFH of the safety function. It need not be considered in the safety-related block diagram. Further presentation of the safety function can however be constructive, since it may be conducive to an understanding of it. In this case, the block is treated as an encapsulated subsystem ("fault exclusion" is then subsequently ticked in SISTEMA, and further entries are not required). Step 5: Is the safety function retained in the event of component faults? The dangerous faults to be assumed for the component in the block under analysis are determined in Step 4. Their effects upon the safety function are now considered.
