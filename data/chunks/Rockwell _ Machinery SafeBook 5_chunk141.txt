440C- CR30 relay for proper status by using Connected Components Workbench software. 5 Replace the connection at P1_00. Cycle power to the 440C-CR30 relay. Press the Reset button on the 440C-CR30 relay. The 440C- CR30 relay outputs must energize. Press and release the external Start button. Confi rm that the motor starts and that the machine begins to operate. 6 Repeat steps 1 through 5 using the K2 feedback connection at terminal P1_01. 134 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Application Examples Verifi cation of the Confi guration The system must verify the confi guration of each individual application by using the Verify command. If the 440C-CR30 confi guration safety relay is not verifi ed, it will fault after 24 hours of operation. ATTENTION: The verifi cation process should be documented in the safety system’s technical fi le. Follow these steps to download and verify the confi guration. 1. Make sure the 440C-CR30 relay is powered up and connected to your workstation via the USB cable. 2. Confi rm that the upper right-hand corner of the Connected Components Workbench Project tab shows that the 440C-CR30 relay is connected. If it is not, click Connect to Device to establish the software connection. 3.Click Verify. 135 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery 4.
