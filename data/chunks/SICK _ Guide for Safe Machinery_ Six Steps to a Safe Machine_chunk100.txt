access to the hazardous area by reaching over a protective field cannot be prevented, the height of the protective field and minimum distance of the ESPE must be determined. This is done by comparing the calculated values based on the possible detection of limbs or body parts with the values resulting from possibly reaching over the protective field. The higher value of this comparison shall be applied. This comparison is to be carried out according to ISO 13855, Section 6.5. If it is not possible to reach over the protective field of the ESPE, C is determined by the detection capability (resolution) of the ESPE and is referred to as C (reach through). If it is possible to reach over the protective field RT of the ESPE, C is determined by the height of the protective field and is referred to as C (reach over).
