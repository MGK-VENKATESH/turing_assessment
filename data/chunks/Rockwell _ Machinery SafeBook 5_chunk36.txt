the use of the equipment for production, and the work is performed using alternative measures, like safeguarding, which provide effective protection. Safeguarding includes devices like interlocked guards, light curtains, and safety mats. Used with appropriate safety rated logic and output devices, operators can safety access the machine danger zones during normal production tasks and minor interventions. The safety of the machine in this case will depend on the proper application and correct operation of the protective system even under fault conditions. The correct operation of the system must now be considered. Within each type there is likely to be a choice of technologies with varying degrees of performance of fault monitoring, detection or prevention. In an ideal world every protective system would be perfect with absolutely no possibility of failing to a dangerous condition. In the real world, however, we are constrained by the current limits of knowledge and materials. Another very real constraint is cost. Based on these factors it becomes obvious that we need to have some way of relating the extent of the protective measures to the level of risk obtained at the risk estimation stage. Whichever type of protective device is chosen it must be remembered that a “safety related system” may contain many elements including the protective device, wiring, power switching device and sometimes parts of the machine’s operational control system. All these elements of the system (including guards, mounting, wiring etc.) should have suitable performance characteristics relevant to their design principle and technology. IEC/EN 62061 and (EN) ISO 13849-1 classify hierarchical levels of performance for safety related parts of control systems and they provide risk assessment methods in their annexes to determine the integrity requirements for a protective system. 31 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery (EN) ISO 13849-1:2015 provides an
