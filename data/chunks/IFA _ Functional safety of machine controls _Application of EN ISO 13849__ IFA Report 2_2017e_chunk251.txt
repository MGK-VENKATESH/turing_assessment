against common cause failure (65 points): separation (15), overvoltage protection etc. (15) and environmental conditions (25 + 10) • The combination of the control elements satisfies Category 3 with a high MTTF (70 years) and low DC (66.2%). D avg This results in an average probability of dangerous failure of 1.6 · 10-7 per hour. This satisfies PL d. 161 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS Figure 8.36: Determining of the PL by means of SISTEMA 162 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS 163 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS 8.2.19 Interlocking device with guard locking – Category 3 – PL d (Example 19) i Changes with respect to the second edition (BGIA Report 2/2008e): The example was comprehensively revised.

Functional description • Access to a hazardous movement is prevented by a guard door with guard locking until the moving part has come to rest (guard locking safety function). The door is held closed by a spring-actuated pin (the locking element) of a solenoid that prevents the actuator being withdrawn from the switch head until the locking solenoid is actuated. • According to the manufacturer, the guard locking has a fail-safe locking element. 164 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS B2.1 K4 Guard locking K2 Mechanic B2.2 K5 •
