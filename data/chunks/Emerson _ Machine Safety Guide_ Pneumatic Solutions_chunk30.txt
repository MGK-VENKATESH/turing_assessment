This allows the implementation of redundant control architectures (dual-channel) for use in categories 3 4 2 and 4 with a maximum performance level e. 14 5 1 3 e Redundant solution with internal pilot: 3 This solution is also available with external pilot. The system can be connected directly to working connection 2. Alternatively, an upstream startup valve can be connected to primary line 1. This startup valve is then actuated by an external 4 2 pneumatic connection. 14 5 1 3 e Dual valve with integrated non-return valve: Alternatively, the ISO 1 version provides you with a variant with an integrated non-return valve, in order to bridge a connected startup valve on connection 4 in the secondary line in case of exhaust. This solution is available with external or X 1 internal pilot. Additional technical data is available in our online catalog. 42 Machine safety | Emerson expertise – AVENTICS-IS12 Series LU6: Static locking or dynamic braking The lock element can be used as a holding unit (blocking of a movement) or as a brake unit (emergency stop/emergency off). LU6 locking unit application: mechanical holding function for piston rods of pneumatic cylinders according to ISO 15552 or comparable round bars; suitable for use in
