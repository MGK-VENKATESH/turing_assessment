in such hazard zones can be avoided, for example by the use of closing edge protection devices. o es f t t i h m e a r t i i s o k n S2 F1 P2 P1 d Closing edge protection devices, such as pressure-sensi- reduction F2 tive edges, are fitted to the closing edges of the moving P2 e wings. When an obstacle is detected, the closing move- ment is interrupted and a reverse movement is initiated. High risk Crush and shear points on powered windows, doors and S2 – Serious, generally irreversible injury gates may cause severe and, under some circumstances, F1 – Infrequent or short exposure P1 – Evasion of the hazardous situation possible fatal injury. A severity of injury of S2 must therefore be P2 – Evasion of the hazardous situation virtually impossible assumed. Persons are infrequently (frequency lower than once every fifteen minutes) and only briefly (total duration of exposure less than 1/20 of the entire operation time) Example 2: Autonomous transport vehicles present in the area of the crushing and shearing points (F1). Under normal circumstances, persons at risk are able On autonomous transport vehicle, collision protection is to move out of the hazard zone formed by the moving assured by the safety function wing (P1). This yields a required Pe Level PL of c. This r result is confirmed by the EN 12453 product standard. The • SF1 – Stopping of the transport vehicle upon approa- standards committee evidently saw no reason to deviate ching an obstacle from this owing to the incidence and severity of accidents. Example 13 in [1] shows how this safety function can be Since an autonomous transport vehicle may, under cer- achieved. tain circumstances, be carrying a load weighing in the order of tons, severe irreversible
