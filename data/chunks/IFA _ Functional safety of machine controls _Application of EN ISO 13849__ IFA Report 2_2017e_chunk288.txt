1V3 is based upon the direct monitoring of the switching state by 1S3. The DC of 60% in each avg case for the directional control valves 1V5 and 2V1 is based upon indirect monitoring by the process. Averaging thus produces a DC of 73% (“low”). avg • Adequate measures against common cause failure (65 points): separation (15), overvoltage protection etc. (15) and environmental conditions (25 + 10) • The combination of the hydraulic control elements satisfies Category 3 with a high MTTF (88 years) and low DC D avg (73%). This results in an average probability of dangerous failure of 9.4 · 10-8 per hour. This satisfies PL e. Following the addition of further SRP/CS in the form of subsystems for completion of the safety function, the PL may under certain circumstances be lower. 199 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS Figure 8.53: Determining of the PL by means of SISTEMA 200 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS 201 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS 8.2.28 Position monitoring of movable guards – Category 4 – PL e (Example 28) Open B1 B2 Closed Safeguard 1 Open B3 B4 Closed Enable K1 Safeguard 2 K3 I1.0 I1.1 I1.2 I1.3 I1.4 Inputs K1 PLC Safety module Outputs O1.0 L K2 Q1 K2 Q1 K3 Q2 Q1 Q2 Figure 8.54: Q2 Position monitoring M 3 of movable guards for the prevention Shown in the actuated position of hazardous movements Safety function • Safety-related stop function, initiated by a safeguard: opening of a movable guard (safety guard) initiates the safety function STO (safe torque off). Functional description • A hazard zone is safeguarded by two movable guards (safety guards). Opening of a safety screen is detected by two position switches B1/B2 respectively B3/B4 comprising break contact/make contact combinations and evaluated by a central safety module K1. K1
