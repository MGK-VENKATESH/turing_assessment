This can be reached underlies this method. For pragmatic application, the category, either with components of good quality (MTTFd = medium) if al- MTTFd, and DC parameters are predefined in this model. most all faults are detected (DC = medium) or with components of very good quality (MTTFd = high) if many faults are detected (DC = low). Risk reduction Technical protective measures Example: Determining the "actuator" subsystem 1) Definition of the "actuator" subsystem The "actuator" subsystem comprises two contactors with "feedback." As the contactor contacts are positively guided, a safety-relevant failure of the contactors can be detected (EDM). The UE410 logic unit itself is not part of the "actuator" subsystem but is used for diagnostic purposes. 1 1 2) Definition of the category Input Monitoring Single-fault
