Functional description • Stopping of the motor is initiated by actuation of the Off button S1. The motor contactor Q1 drops out and the bra- king function is initiated. The motor is braked by a direct current, which is generated in the braking device K1 by a phase-angle control with thyristors, generating a braking torque in the motor winding. • The stopping time must not exceed a maximum value (e.g. 10 seconds). The level of braking current required for this purpose can be set by means of a potentiometer on the braking device. • After expiration of the maximum braking time, the thyristor is no longer activated and the current path for the braking current is interrupted. The stopping process corresponds to a stop of Category 1 in accordance with IEC 60204-1. • The safety function cannot be maintained with all component failures, and dependents upon the reliability of the components. • No measures for fault detection are implemented. 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS S1 Q1 K1 Design features • Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. Protective circuits (such as contact protection) as described in the initial paragraphs of Chapter 8 are implemented. The de-energi- zation principle (closed current principle) is applied as a
