on Control Reliable The most fundamental aspect of Control Reliable is single fault tolerance and monitoring (fault detection). The requirements state how the safety system must respond in the presence of “a single fault,” “any single fault,” or “any single component failure.” Three very important concepts must be considered regarding faults: (1) not all faults are detected, (2) adding the word “component” raises questions about wiring, and (3) wiring is an integral part of the safety system. Wiring faults can result in the loss of a safety function. 109 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery The intent of Control Reliability is clearly the performance of the safety function in the presence of a fault. If the fault is detected, then the safety system must execute a safe action, provide notifi cation of the fault, and prevent further operation of the machine until the fault is corrected. If the fault is not detected, then the safety function must still be performed upon demand. Chapter 10: Application Examples Overview - Pre-engineered safety functions for machines Machinery safety functions – be it an emergency stop, guarding, or presence sensing function – require multiple elements including a sensor or input device, a logic device, and an output device. Together, these elements provide a level of protection calculated by Performance Level as outlined in (EN) ISO 13849-1. In this chapter we have selected one of many pre-engineered safety functions for machines that Rockwell Automation have developed. These safety function documents each provide guidance for a specifi c safety function based on functional requirement, equipment selection, and performance level requirement, including set-up and wiring, confi guration, verifi cation and validation plan, and calculation of performance level. The pre-engineered safety functions are free and are available to download on the Rockwell Automation website. www.rockwellautomation.com,
