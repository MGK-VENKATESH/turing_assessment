of avoiding damage” determine the required safety level. Applicable standards • ISO 13849-1 uses a risk graph to determine the required safety level. The result of the procedure is a “required performance level” (PLr). • ISO 13849-1 is also applicable to hydraulic, pneumatic, and mechanical systems. • IEC 62061 uses a numerical method to determine the required safety level. The result is a required safety integrity level (SIL). 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 53 Subject to change without notice 3c – Designing the safety function Steps 3c and 3d describe the design and verification of the safety functions. These steps may need to be performed several times in an iterative process. Step 3c includes the development of the safety concept, the selection of the protective devices, the integration into the controller, and the verification of the safety function. NOTE During this process it is necessary to repeatedly check whether the selection of the technology offers sufficient safety and is also technically feasible, or whether other risks or additional risks are produced by the use of a specific technology. Safety concept Develop a concept for the required safety functions. A machine or system consists of several components that interact and ensure the functionality of a machine or system. A distinction must be made here between components that perform pure operating tasks and ones that are responsible for safety-related functions.
