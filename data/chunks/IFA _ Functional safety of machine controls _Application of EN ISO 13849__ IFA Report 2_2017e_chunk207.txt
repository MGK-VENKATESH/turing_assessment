actuates a contactor Q1. The dropping out of Q1 interrupts or prevents hazardous movements or states. • The safety function cannot be maintained with all component failures, and is dependent upon the reliability of the components. • No measures for fault detection are implemented. • Removal of the protective device is not detected. Design features • Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. Protective circuits (such as contact protection) as described in the initial paragraphs of Chapter 8 are implemented. The closed-circuit current principle is employed as a basic safety principle. Earthing of the control circuit is regarded as a well-tried safety principle. • Switch B1 is a position switch with direct opening contact in accordance with IEC 60947-5-1, Annex K and is there- fore regarded as a well-tried component. The break contact interrupts the circuit directly mechanically when the safeguard is not in the safe position. • Contactor Q1 is a well-tried component provided the additional conditions in accordance with Table D.3 of EN ISO 13849-2 are met. 116 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS B1 Q1 • A position switch is employed for position monitoring. A stable arrangement of the safeguard is assured for actua- tion of the position switch. The actuating elements of the position switch are protected against displacement. Only rigid mechanical parts are employed (no spring elements acting in the direction of the actuating force). • The actuating stroke for the position switch complies with the manufacturer‘s specification. Calculation of the probability of failure • MTTF : an MTTF of 20 · 106 switching cycles [M] is stated for B1. At 365 working days, 16 working hours per day and D D a cycle time of 10 minutes, the n for these components is 35,040 cycles per year,
