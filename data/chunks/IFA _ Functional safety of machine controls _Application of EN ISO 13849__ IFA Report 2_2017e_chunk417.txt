Where demands are small influence upon the PFH in this sense. Only for the D made continually upon the safety function (continuous designated architecture for Category 2 must testing at a mode of operation), it indicates the number of dangerous frequency substantially higher than that of the demand system failures per hour. For Category 2, a requirement is of the safety function be made a requirement (alterna- that testing is fully effective. This can be attained by an tively: testing takes place immediately upon demand adequate relationship between the test and demand rate and the times for fault detection and safe response are or by an adequately fast response to a fault (cf. subclause together shorter than the specified system response 6.2.14). Since the PFH determined in this way considers time; cf. EN ISO 13849-1, subclause 4.5.4). The standard D only random failures and not systematic failures and other proposes a test rate that is at least 100 times that of the negative effects, it must be regarded as a theoretical per- demand rate.
