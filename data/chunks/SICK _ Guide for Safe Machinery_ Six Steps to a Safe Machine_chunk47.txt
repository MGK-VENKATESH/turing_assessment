detailed information, see section see "Automatic material passage using ESPE", page 78. Monitoring machine parameters In some applications, it is necessary to monitor various machine parameters for safety-related limits. If a limit is exceeded, suitable measures are initiated (e.g., stop, warning signal). Examples: • Monitoring of speed, temperature, or pressure • Position monitoring for collision avoidance Figure 27: Monitoring the robot position using an inductive proximity sensor 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 47 Subject to change without notice 3A – DEFINING THE SAFETY FUNCTIONS Safeguarding work areas shared by humans and machines If the operation of a machine requires a workspace to which both a worker and hazardous parts of the machine (e.g., a robot) need access at different times, it must be ensured that any contact or collision is avoided. Additional safety functions may be necessary to avoid an unexpected restart. Figure 28: Safeguarding a shared work area for humans and robots using safety light curtains Disabling safety functions manually and for a limited time If it is necessary for setup work or process monitoring to operate the machine with the protective function of the protective devices disabled, a suitable operat‐ ing mode should be provided that meets the following requirements: • Operating mode is only activated when an operat‐ ing mode selector switch is in the corresponding position. • Operating mode locks all other control and operat‐ ing modes of the machine. • Operating mode does not allow machine move‐ ments due to direct or indirect action on sensors or linked sequences. • Operating mode allows dangerous machine func‐ tions only while command devices (e.g., enabling switch) are continuously actuated and under reduced risk conditions (e.g. limitation of speed, movement path, function duration).
