no higher than a SIL2 rating, regardless of the probability of dangerous failure. When combining subsystems, the 89 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery SIL achieved by the SRCS is constrained to be less than or equal to the lowest SIL CL of any of the subsystems involved in the safety-related control function System Realization To compute the probability of dangerous failure, each safety function must be broken down into function blocks, which are then realized as subsystems. A system design implementation of a typical safety function would include a sensing device connected to a logic device connected to an actuator. This creates a series arrangement of subsystems. As we have already seen, if we can determine the probability of dangerous failure for each subsystem and know its SIL CL, then the system probability of failure is easily calculated by adding the probability of failures of the subsystems. This concept is shown below.
