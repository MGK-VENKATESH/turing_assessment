the danger area. The design and placement of the guard depends upon the time it takes to stop the mechanism and the speed at which the person’s hand can reach across the distance from the guard to the danger zone. 19 July 2021 SLAC-I-730-0A21T-016-R003 4 of 12 SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory Environment, Safety & Health Division Machine and Portable Tools | Machine Safeguarding Guideline 2.2.1.1 Electromechanical Sensing Device An electromechanical presence-sensing device has a probe or contact bar that descends to a predetermined distance when the operator initiates the machine cycle. If there is an obstruction preventing it from descending its full pre-determined distance, the control unit does not actuate the machine cycle. 2.2.2 Pullback A pullback utilizes a series of cables attached to the operator’s hands, wrists, or arms which withdraws hands when the slide/ram begins to descend. It is primarily used on machines with full-revolution stroking action and allows access to the point of operation when the slide/ram is up. 19 July 2021 SLAC-I-730-0A21T-016-R003 5 of 12 SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory Environment, Safety & Health Division Machine and Portable Tools | Machine Safeguarding Guideline 2.2.3 Restraint A restraint uses cables or straps attached to the operator’s hands and a fixed point. It must be adjusted to let the operator’s hands travel within a predetermined safe area. 2.3 Safety Controls 2.3.1 Pressure-sensitive Body Bar When depressed, a pressure-sensitive body bar will deactivate the machine. If the operator or anyone trips, loses balance, or is drawn into the machine, applying pressure to the bar will stop the operation. 19 July 2021 SLAC-I-730-0A21T-016-R003 6 of 12 SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory Environment, Safety & Health Division Machine and Portable Tools | Machine Safeguarding Guideline 2.3.2 Safety Triprod When pressed by the operator's hand, a safety tripod deactivates the machine. Because it has
