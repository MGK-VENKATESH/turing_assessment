height of the physical guard is to be 1,600 mm, the safety distance must be increased to at least 800 mm. Proceed as follows to determine the required height of the top edge of the physical guard for this safety distance: 1. Determine the height of the hazardous point a and find the value in the left-hand column, e.g., 1,000 mm. 2. In this row, find the first column in which the horizontal distance C is less than the safety distance calculated, e.g., the first field with the value “0”. 3. Read the resulting height b for the physical guard in the bottom row, e.g., 1,800 mm.

Distance ring Figure 91: Minimum distance of a two-hand control device Example: Minimum distance for two-hand control device S = (K × T) + C S Minimum distance in millimeters measured from the control to the nearest hazardous point K Parameter in millimeters per second, derived from the data for the approach speeds of the body or parts of the body, usually 1,600 mm/s T Stopping/run-down time of the overall system from when the control is released in seconds C Supplement 250 mm. It might not be required under certain conditions (e.g., covering of the control switch). NOTE - Calculation of the minimum distance: ISO 13855
