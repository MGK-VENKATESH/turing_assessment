wiring costs as the input devices are daisy- chained. Assume a short circuit fault occurs across one of the contacts at Sw2 as shown. Can this fault be detected? If switch Sw1 (or Sw3) is opened, both Ch1 and Ch2 are open circuit and the MSR removes power from the hazard. If Sw3 is then opened and then closed again the fault across its contacts will not be detected because there is no change of status at the MSR: both Ch1 and Ch2 remain open. If Sw1 (or Sw3) is then closed, the 102 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety-Related Control Systems, Additional Considerations hazard can be restarted by pressing the start button. Under these circumstances the fault did not cause a loss of the safety function but it was not detected, it remains in the system and a subsequent fault (a short circuit across the second contact of Sw2) could lead to the loss of the safety function. If Sw2 alone was opened and closed, with no operation of the other switches, Ch1 opens and Ch2 remains closed. The MSR de-energizes the hazard because Ch1 opened. When Sw2 closes, the motor cannot be started when the Start button is pressed, because Ch2 did not open. The fault is detected. However if for any reason, Sw1 (or Sw3) is then opened and closed, both Ch1 and Ch2 will be open then closed circuit. This sequence simulates the clearing of the fault and will result in unintentional reset at the MSR. This raises the question of what DC could be claimed for the individual switches within this structure when using (EN) ISO 13849-1 or IEC 62061? Up until the publication of ISO TR 24119 (November 2015: Evaluation of fault masking serial connection of interlocking devices associated with guards with potential free contacts) there
