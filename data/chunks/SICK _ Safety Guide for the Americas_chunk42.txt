they func- tion within specified limits. The design Examples: should also always be as simple as • Mechanical design possible. Safety-related functions are to • Operating and maintenance concept be separated from other functions as far • Electrical equipment (electrical safety, as possible. EMC) • Concepts for stopping in an emer- gency situation • Equipment involving fluids • Materials and resources used • Machine function and production process - Alfred Neudörfer: Konstruieren sicherheitsgerechter Produkte, Springer- Verlag, Berlin u. a., ISBN 978-3642191886 (4th Edition 2011) Safe design Risk reduction Operating and maintenance concept The need for exposure to the hazard should be kept as low as Color marking possible. This objective can be achieved, for example, by means Controls on pushbuttons as well as indicators or information of: displayed on monitors are to be marked in color. The various • Automatic loading and unloading stations colors have different meanings. • Setup and maintenance work from outside the hazardous area(s) • Use of reliable, available components to prevent mainte- 1 nance work • Clear and unambiguous operating concept, e.g., clear mark- ing of controls - Color coding convention for industrial machinery: NFPA 79, IEC 60204-1 2 Table 1: Preferred Colors for Indicator Lights and Icons Table 2: Alternate Colors for Indicator Lights and Icons Purpose Condition of Machine/Process Color (preferred purpose, unless otherwise agreed) Color Safety of People or State of Equipment Environment Status Action by Operator Status Status Immediate action to deal with Emergency hazardous condition (hazardous (for example switching off the Red Red Danger Faulty condition) machine supply, being alert to the hazardous condition and staying clear of the machine) Abnormal (abnormal or Monitoring and/or intervention Yellow impending (for example by re-establishing Yellow Warning / Caution Abnormal Amber critical the intended function) Amber condition) Green Normal Optional Green Safe Normal
