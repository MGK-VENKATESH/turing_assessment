The transfer key is only available when the means of access (movable physical guard) is closed and locked. • Detection in the active protective field of a horizon‐ tally arranged safety light curtain. The “Initiating a stop” function is implemented by means of the vertical protective field of the safety light curtain. Figure 24: Preventing start-up by means of a horizontal safety light curtain Combination of initiating a stop/preventing start Restart is prevented using the same protective device that initiates the stop as long as there are persons or parts of the body in the hazardous area. Examples: • A two-hand control on single-person workplaces • Use of a safety light curtain so that standing behind or reaching around is not possible (hazard‐ ous point protection) • Use of a safety laser scanner for area protection Figure 25: Initiating a stop and preventing start using a safety laser scanner (hazardous area monitoring) 46 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 3A – DEFINING THE SAFETY FUNCTIONS Allowing material passage To move materials in or out of the hazardous area, spe‐ cific features of the materials moved are used for mate‐ rial detection or to automatically differentiate between material and people. The protective device is then not actuated during material transport; however, people are detected. Examples: • Selecting suitable sensors and placing them in appropriate positions enables the material to be detected and the safety function to be tempora‐ rily suspended while the material passes through (muting). • Protective field switching on a safety laser scanner • Horizontal light curtains with integrated algorithm for human-material differentiation Figure 26: Access monitoring and allowing a car body to be transferred through a horizontal safety light curtain with inte‐ grated human-material differentiation NOTE - For more
