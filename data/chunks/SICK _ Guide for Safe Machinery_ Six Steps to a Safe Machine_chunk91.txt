a set resistance (a few kOhms) is a switch contact is opened on activation detected. These designs require more complex evaluation. of the protective device. A short-circuit between the cables can be prevented by using a special cable layout. NOTE Design of pressure sensitive protective devices: Type-B standard ISO 13856 (series of standards) Complementary protective measures If necessary, provision must be made for further protective measures which are neither inherently safe designs or technical precautionary measures. These might include: • Emergency stop devices • Measures to free and rescue persons who have become trapped • Measures for isolating and dissipating energy (see "Power supply connection", page 31 and see "Mains disconnection device", page 33) • Preventive measures for easy and safe handling of machines and heavy parts • Measures for safe access to machinery 88 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION If these complementary measures are dependent upon the correct function of the corresponding control compo‐ nents, then they are safety functions. The requirements on functional safety must be met for these measures. (see "Application of reset and restart", page 110). Emergency operation To prevent impending hazards to persons, damage to machines or production processes, or to minimize exist‐ ing ones, functions must be provided for such emergen‐ cies. These functions, which cause machine functions to stop (emergency stop) or electrical power to be dis‐ connected (emergency switching off) in an emergency, are complementary protective measures for hazards on machines. They do not replace the use of inherently safer design or protective devices.
