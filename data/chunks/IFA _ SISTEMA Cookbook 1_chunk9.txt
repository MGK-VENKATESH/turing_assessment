of two undetected faults, the subsystem satisfies Category 4. If the safety function is not retained at the second undetected fault, the subsystem satisfies Category 3. In Example 1 (Figure 3), PLC K1 could actuate outputs O1.0 and O1.1 continuously in the event of a fault. Q1 would be continually energized in this case. Even if the PLC were able to detect this fault by reading back of the monitoring contacts, it would not be able to bring about the safe state. Should a second fault then cause the contacts of Q2 to weld, the motor would continue to run even with the protective equipment open; the safety function has failed, and Category 4 is not met. Note: In Category 4, single-fault tolerance must be satisfied and the discrete fault in a com- ponent in the first or second functional channel must be detected at or before the next demand upon the safety function. If detection in this way is not possible, an accumu- lation of two undetected faults must not lead to loss of the safety function. Step 6: Are component faults detected? At this point, it is clear that there is no redundancy and that consequently neither Category 3 nor Category 4 is met. If failure of a block in a test channel is detected by a test channel and the safe state is brought about, the subsystem satisfies Category 2. In Example 2 (Figure 4), tripping of B0 causes controlled stopping of the motor by T1/G1 within 1/3 of a rotation. Testing is in response to a demand by K1 prompted by manual actua- tion of B0 and measurement of the stopping angle by K1/G2. In the event of a fault, the safe state is brought about via Q1. The test detects faults in B0 and T1/G1.
