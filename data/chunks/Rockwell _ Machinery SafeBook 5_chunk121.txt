programmable safety controllers have their own internal diagnostics and they check themselves to ensure proper performance. Therefore they can be rated as safety components to meet Categories 2, 3 or 4 without any additional measures. MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety-Related Control Systems, Additional Considerations Fault Considerations and Exclusions Safety analysis requires extensive analysis of faults, and a thorough understanding of the performance of the safety system in the presence of faults is needed. ISO 13849-1 and ISO 13849-2 provide details on fault considerations and fault exclusions. If a fault results in a failure of a subsequent component, the fi rst fault and all the subsequent faults shall be considered a single fault. If two or more faults occur as a result of a single cause, the faults shall be considered a single fault. This is known as a common cause fault. The occurrence of two or more independent faults at the same time is considered to be highly unlikely and is not considered in this analysis. Fault Exclusions (EN) ISO 13849-1 and IEC 62061 permit the use of fault exclusions when determining a safety system classifi cation if it can be shown that the occurrence of the fault is extremely unlikely. It is important that where fault exclusions are used that they are properly justifi ed and are valid for the intended lifetime of the safety system. The greater the level of risk protected by the safety system then the more stringent becomes the justifi cation required for the fault exclusion. This has always caused some confusion about when certain types of fault exclusion can or cannot be used. As we have seen already in this chapter, recent standards and guidance documents have clarifi ed some aspects of this issue. In general, where PLe or SIL3 is specifi ed for a
