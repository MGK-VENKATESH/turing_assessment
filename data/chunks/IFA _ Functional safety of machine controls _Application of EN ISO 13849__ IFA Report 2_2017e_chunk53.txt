Detection of intervention by further persons in the r rable machines, the PL can in principle be reduced by one danger zone by means of ESPE (electro-sensitive pro- r level. However, since the safety functions on comparable tective equipment), e.g. a light curtain, and immediate paper-cutting guillotines are achieved with the highest PL, interruption of the cutting operation a reduction of the PL will not be possible in this case (see r subclause 5.7.4). • SF4 – Automatic stopping of all movements following each individual cut or following completion of the auto- Risk evaluation matic cutting sequence In consideration of all operating conditions and all possi- • SF5 – Reduction of the dynamic press force for the clam- bilities for operator intervention, a risk reduction is found ping bar during the “indicate cut” function to be required. • SF6 – Automatic return of the clamping bar and knife to Inherently safe design their initial positions following interruption of a cutting operation It is not possible for the dynamic press force of the clam- ping bar and the energy of the knife to be reduced, as this Note: The principle of overlapping hazards could be would impair the functionality of the machine.
