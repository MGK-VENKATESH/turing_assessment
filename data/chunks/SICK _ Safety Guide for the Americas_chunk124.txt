Increase height of top edge The height of the hazard zone a and the supplement deter- S mined by the resolution C are used to calculate the required RT 2 height of the top edge of the protective field b when the C K x T RT minimum distance S remains unchanged. With the top edge of the protective field calculated at this height, it is not possible to Hazard zone reach over and into the hazard zone and a C supplement is RO not necessary. 3 c b a Floor Parameters for determining the required minimum distance for reaching through Increase minimum distance (height of top edge prescribed) If the top edge of the protective field b is prescribed by a pre- S Hazard zone existing product, the minimum distance S must be increased. This is achieved with the determination of the height of the C RO K x T hazard zone a and the height of the top edge of the protective field b. The result of the intersection produced in the table below represents the intrusion distance C . If C ≥ C , the C RO RO RT RO value replaces the C value in the calculation of the minimum RT distance. b a If C < C , the C value shall be used to calculate the mini- RO RT RT mum distance. Floor Parameters for determining the required minimum distance with possibility of reaching over The rule of thumb is: C ≥ C and C ≥ C RO (reaching over) RT(reaching through) The table from RIA TR R15.406 and ISO 13855 as well as practical examples can be found on the following pages. 3-56 GUIDE FOR SAFE MACHINERY | SICK 7028282/2014-09-08 Subject to change without notice Risk reduction Safeguarding (technical protective measures) To take
