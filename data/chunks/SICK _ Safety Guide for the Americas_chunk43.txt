There are two different types of hazard: direct or indirect contact • Dangers arising from situations indirectly due to faults in the control system - In the following sections you will find important information on the design of the electrical equipment. - Electrical safety standards: NFPA 70, NFPA 70E, NFPA 79, CSA Z462, NR-10, IEC 60204-1 2-4 GUIDE FOR SAFE MACHINERY | SICK 7028282/2014-09-08 Subject to change without notice Risk reduction Safe design Electrical power supply connection The electrical power supply connection is the interface between the electrical equipment in the machine and the supply grid. The stipulations from the utility concerned are to be followed for the connection. A stable power supply is particularly important in safety-related applications. For this reason, the voltage supplies should be able to withstand brief power failures. 1 Earthing system The earthing system characterizes both the type of connec- tion on the secondary side of the supply transformer to earth and the type of earthing for the electrical equipment’s chassis. TN system Three earthing systems are standardized internationally: The TN system is the most common form of network in low volt- • TN system age systems. In the TN system the transformer’s star point is 2 • TT system directly connected to earth (system earthing); the chassis of the • IT system equipment connected are connected to the transformer’s star Earthing is
