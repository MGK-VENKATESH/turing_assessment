[C]. Value CCF factor (β) IEC 62061 contains no statements about the behavior of mechanical ≤ 35 10% components. Therefore, the fault rate λ is determined based on ISO D 13849-1. It is assumed that the fault rate remains constant during 36 to 65 5% application. 66 to 85 2% General conditions according to the manufacturer: 86 to 100 1% • B = 2,600,000 10d • C = 1/hour (assumed value) 1 PFHd ≈β×(λ D1 + λ D2 )×½ These general conditions result in an λ of 3.8 × 10–8 . D h b) Based on the CCF factor (β) ≈β×λ D Measures to avoid common cause failures are required in multi- C channel systems. The effect is determined based on measures as per ≈0.05 × 0.1 × ---------------- B the requirements of IEC 62061. In the example, the factor is 5% (see 10d below: "5) Evaluation of measures to avoid common cause faults") PFHd ≈1.9 × 10-9 PFHd ≈ 1.9 × 10–9. 4) Determination of the SFF via DC As the contacts are positively guided, a "high" DC (99%) is derived. DC = 99 % λ S λ DD In other words, 99% of 70% of dangerous faults λ D for contactors are SFF= 99.3 % detected. Accordingly, the SFF = 30% + 69.3% = 99.3%. λDU 5) Evaluation of measures to avoid common cause faults Value CCF factor (β) Measures to avoid common cause failures are required in multi-chan- nel systems. The evaluation of the measures as per IEC 62061 yields ≤ 35 10% in this example a CCF factor (β) of 5%. 36 to 65 5% 66 to 85 2% 86 to 100 1% 3-92 GUIDE FOR SAFE MACHINERY | SICK 7028282/2014-09-08 Subject to change without notice Risk reduction Technical protective measures Example: Determining the SILCL and
