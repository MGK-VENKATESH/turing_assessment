comprise a combination of dual channel and single channel blocks. If we want to investigate the system in more depth we need to look at the components parts of the blocks. The SISTEMA tool uses the term “elements” for these component parts.

The output contactor subsystem is subdivided down to its block level. The logic subsystem is not subdivided because it is already qualifi ed and validated by the manufacturer to a given PL. The monitoring function for both the limit switches and the contactors is performed by the logic controller. Therefore the boxes representing the limit switch and contactor subsystems have a small overlap with the logic subsystem box. This principle of system subdivision can be recognised in the methodology given in (EN) ISO 13849-1 and in the basic system structure principle for the SISTEMA tool. However it is important to note that there are some subtle differences. The standard is not restrictive in its methodology, but for the simplifi ed method for estimating the PL the usual fi rst step is to break the complete system into channels and then into the blocks within each channel. With SISTEMA it is usually more convenient to divide the system into subsystems and then each subsystem into blocks. The standard does not explicitly describe a subsystem concept but its use as given in SISTEMA provides a more understandable and intuitive approach. Of course there is no effect on
