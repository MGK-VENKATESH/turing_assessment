movement being halted by T1 and/or Q1. The wings of the door can be opened manually in order for trapped persons to be freed. • Owing to redundant processing channels, a single fault does not result in loss of the safety functions. The combi- nation of undetected faults may lead to loss of the safety functions. Design features • Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. Protective circuits (such as contact protection) as described in the initial paragraphs of Chapter 8 are implemented. • The pressure-sensitive edge serves as a safeguard against crush, shear and entrapment points. The pressure- sensitive edge and the control unit are treated as a single unit (B1). The subsystem B1 satisfies the requirements of EN ISO 13856-2 in Category 3 and of EN ISO 13849-1 for PL d. Faults in the signal generator of the pressure-sensitive edge or in the supply conductors must be excluded or be detected via the control unit (pressure-sensitive edges operating on either the break-contact or make-contact principle may be employed). Following actuation and sub- sequent release of pressure upon a pressure-sensitive edge, the rotary movement begins again with a time delay. The pressure-sensitive edge possesses an adequate deformation path and an adequate range of action. • The light barrier has the function of leading, non-contact safeguarding of hazard zones. The light barrier system B2 satisfies the requirements for Type 4 to IEC 61496-1 and IEC 61496-2 and for PL e to EN ISO 13849-1. The reduced, safely limited revolving speed that is assumed following detection of a person or an object by the light barrier is increased again to the normal speed following a preset timeout. The supply conductors to the transmitter and receiver are laid separately or with protection. • During
