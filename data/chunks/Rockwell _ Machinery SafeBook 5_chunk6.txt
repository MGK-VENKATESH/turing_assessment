show evidence that proves conformity with the EHSRs. This fi le should include all relevant information such as test results, drawings, specifi cations, etc. A harmonized European (EN) Standard TEST that is listed in the Offi cial Journal of RESULTS ------------- the European Union (OJ) under the - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - S- - - - - - T- - ANDARDS Machinery Directive, and whose date of cessation of presumption of conformity has not expired, confers a presumption of conformity with certain of the EHSR’s. (Many recent standards listed in the OJ include a cross-reference identifying the EHSR’s that are covered by the standard). Therefore, where Machine must meet EHSRs equipment complies with such current harmonized European standards, the task of demonstrating conformity with the EHSR’s is greatly simplifi ed, and the manufacturer also benefi ts from the increased legal certainty. These standards are not legally required, however, their use is strongly recommended since proving conformity by alternative methods can be an extremely complex issue. These standards support the Machinery Directive and are produced by CEN (the European Committee for Standardization) in cooperation with ISO, and CENELEC (the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization) in cooperation with IEC. A thorough, documented risk assessment must be conducted to ensure that all potential machine hazards are addressed. Similarly, it is the responsibility of the machine manufacturer to ensure that all EHSR’s are satisfi ed, even those that are not addressed by harmonized EN Standards. 5 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery Technical File The manufacturer or his authorized representative must prepare a Technical File to provide
