in this case for the main protective device (e.g., a vertical light cur‐ tain that has the task of stopping the machine). Figure 79: Safety laser scanner on a machining center as safety function pos. 1, initiating a stop and safety function pos. 2, preventing start (presence detection) Special case 3: ESPE applications on autonomous vehicles If the dangerous state is as a result of a collision with an autonomous vehicle, the determination of the mini‐ mum distance is generally based only on the speed the vehicle is traveling and not on the approach speed of the person. It is assumed that the person recognizes the approaching vehicle (vehicle with protective device) and stops or moves away. Figure 80: Hazardous area protection on an autonomous vehicle with safety laser scanners The minimum distance needs to be set to a length that is sufficient to stop the vehicle safely. The minimum distance corresponds to the braking distance of the vehicle. An exact calculation of the braking distance is not possible, as it depends on several factors, e.g., friction between the tire and ground, total weight incl. load, braking force, etc. It is therefore recommended to first calculate the minimum distance and validate (confirm) the result by testing. 98 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION For the calculation, the braking deceleration of the vehicle (a) at nominal load, maximum operating speed (v ) 0 and under the intended operating conditions must be known or determined. The braking distance (S ) is then B calculated as follows: 2 v0 S = B 2a Safety supplements may be necessary depending on the application and the technology used. The calculated value must be validated by two tests: 1. For detecting
