value of 100 years [M] is applied for T1s. A B value of 400,000 cycles [S] is substituted for K3. At one 10D actuation per day, n is 365 cycles per year, and the MTTF is 10,959 years. A B value of 1,000,000 cycles [M] is op D 10D substituted for Q1, resulting in an MTTF of 27,397 years. The brake Q1 is required only in the event of a fault, and is D not subject to operational wear. Overall, the symmetrized MTTF value for the two channels is 82 years (“high”). D • DC : owing to internal self-tests and comparison, the DC for K1 and K2 is 60%. Internal self-tests are performed on avg the microcontroller components. Ramp monitoring yields a DC of 99% for the block T1s. Owing to the comparison performed by way of K1 and K2, G1 and G2 are rated with a DC of 99%. With direct monitoring of a read-back mecha- nically linked contact element, K3 is rated accordingly with a DC of 99%. Owing to performance of the static start- up test, a DC of 30% is substituted for Q1. Averaging thus yields a DC of 95% (“medium”). avg • Adequate measures against common cause failure (70 points): separation (15), FMEA (5), overvoltage protection etc. (15) and environmental conditions (25 + 10) • The combination of the control elements satisfies Category 3 with a high MTTF of each channel (82 years) and D medium DC (95%). This yields an average probability of dangerous failure PFH of 4.3 · 10-8 per hour. Together avg D with the sensor unit B1 (consisting of a pressure-sensitive edge and control unit) and the frequency inverter T1, the overall average probability of dangerous failure of the control for this safety function is 3.6 · 10-7 per hour.
