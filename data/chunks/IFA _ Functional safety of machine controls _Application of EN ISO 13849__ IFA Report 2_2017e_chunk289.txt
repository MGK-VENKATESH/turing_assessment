actuates two contactors, Q1 and Q2, dropping out of which interrupts or prevents hazardous movements or states. 202 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS B1 Q1 K1 B2 Q2 K3 K2 • For fault detection purposes, all position switch states are read by a second contact into a standard PLC K3, the chief purpose of which is functional control. In the event of a fault, K3 can de-energize the contactors Q1 and Q2 independently of K1 by means of a contactor relay K2. Faults in K2, Q1 and Q2 are detected by the safety module K1. The safety function is retained in the event of a component failure. The majority of component failures are detected and lead to operating inhibition. An accumulation of undetected faults does not result in loss of the safety func- tion. Design features • Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. Protective circuits (such as contact protection) as described in the initial paragraphs of Chapter 8 are implemented. • A stable arrangement of the guards is assured for actuation of the position switches. • B1 and B3 are position switches with a direct opening contact in accordance with IEC 60947-5-1, Annex K. • The supply conductors to the position switches are laid separately or with protection. • Faults in the actuating and operating mechanism are detected by the use of two position switches differing in the principle of their actuation (break and make contact combination). • Several safeguards may be cascaded. Cascading limits the facility for K1 to detect faults (see Annex E). The position switches are however additionally monitored by K3; this results in faults being detected even where safeguards are cascaded. • The safety module K1 satisfies all requirements for Category 4 and PL e. • The
