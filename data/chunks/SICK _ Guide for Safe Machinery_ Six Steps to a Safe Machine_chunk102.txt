In particular for metal-working presses, the following applies: Table 37: Supplements for the minimum distances of ESPE on presses according to ISO 16092-1 and ISO 16092-3 Calculation of the supplement for presses Resolution d (mm) of the ESPE Supplement C (mm) Stroke initiation by ESPE/PSDI mode d ≤ 14 0 Allowed 14 < d ≤ 20 80 20 < d ≤ 30 130 30 < d ≤ 40 240 Not allowed > 40 850 NOTE - Press standards: ISO 16092-1, ISO 16092-3 (type-C standards) 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 97 Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION Special case 2: ESPE for presence detection This type of protection is recommended for large sys‐ tems that are accessible from the floor. In this special case, starting of the machine (“preventing start” safety function) must be prevented while there is an opera‐ tor inside. This is a secondary protective device which detects the presence of persons in the hazardous area and simultaneously prevents the machine switching to the dangerous state. In addition to the ESPE for presence detection, there shall be a primary protective measure for the “initiating a stop” safety function, e.g., in the form of another ESPE or a locked, movable physi‐ cal guard. The minimum distance shall be calculated
