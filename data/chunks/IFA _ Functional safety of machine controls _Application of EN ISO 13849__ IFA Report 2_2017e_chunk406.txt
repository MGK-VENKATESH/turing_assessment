An individual test measure machine for example is prevented following closing of generally acts upon an entire block (e.g. cross monito- the door on which the switch is defective. If, in addition ring): the discrete value can then simply be adopted for to the door on which the position switch has failed the block. Further permutations exist, however: dangerously, a further door is opened, fault detection is (depending upon the sequence) not possible. Casca- • If a block is monitored by a number of individual meas- ding thus leads to a reduction in the DC; this is depen- ures (see Figure E.2), the block DC is at least as good as dent upon factors including the number of guard doors the best individual DC. Should the measures mutually and the frequency with which they are opened. Details complement each other, a higher block DC may even be of such constellations and of estimation of the DC for possible; this DC however must then be determined by them can be found in ISO/TR 24119 [3]. Subclause 6.1 of analysis of the failures covered by each test, similar to this standard excludes PL e for cascading. If, as shown an FMEA. in Example 28 (see subclause 8.2.28), an additional contact is employed for fault detection for each position • A block consists of several units, each of which is tes- switch, fault detection is also not restricted for casca- ted by different measures, for example programmable ding, and PL e is attainable.
