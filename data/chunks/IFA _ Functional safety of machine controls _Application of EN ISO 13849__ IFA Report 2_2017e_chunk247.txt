2, unloading): for the position switch B3 with separate actuator and the direct opening contacts B3.1 D and B3.2, a B value of 4,000,000 cycles [M] is stated for each contact. At 220 working days, 16 working hours per 10D day and a cycle time of 10 minutes, n for these components is 21,120 cycles per year, and the MTTF 1,893 years. op D For the contactor Q1, the B value corresponds under inductive load (AC 3) to the electrical durability of 1,000,000 10 switching cycles [M]. Since 50% of failures are assumed to be dangerous, the B value is produced by doubling of 10D the B value. Since the contactor Q1 is involved in both safety-related stop functions (loading and unloading), dou- 10 bling the value assumed for n yields an MTTF of 473 years. The MTTF for the frequency inverter T1 is 20 years [M]. op D D Altogether, the symmetrized MTTF value per channel in the subsystem Q1/T1 is 68 years (“high”). D • DC : the DC of 99% for B1 and B2/B3 is based upon plausibility monitoring in K2/K3. This corresponds to the DC avg avg for the subsystem. The DC of 99% for the contactor Q1 is derived from readback of the contact position in the safety modules. Fault detection by the process yields a DC of 60% for the frequency inverter T1. Averaging thus results in a DC of 62% (“low”) for the subsystem Q1/T1. An adequate test rate of the emergency-stop device is assured (refer avg to the information in subclauses 6.2.14 and D.2.5.1). • Adequate measures against common cause failure in the subsystems S1.1/S1.2, B2/B1, B3.1/B3.2 and Q1/T2 (65, 70 or 85 points): separation (15), protection against overvoltage etc. (15) and environmental conditions (25 + 10), well-tried components in B2/B1 (5),
