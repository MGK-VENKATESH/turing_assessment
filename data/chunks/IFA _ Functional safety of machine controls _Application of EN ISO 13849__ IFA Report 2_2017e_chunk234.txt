a brake 2Z1 on the piston rod respectively. The brake 2Z1 is actuated by a control valve 2V1. • Failure of one of these valves or of the brake alone does not result in loss of the safety function. • The directional control valve and the brake are actuated cyclically in the process. 144 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS 1V1 2V1 2Z1 2S1 1S1 • The functioning of the control valve 2V1 is monitored by means of a pressure switch 2S1. Certain faults on the unmonitored directional control valve 1V1 and the unmonitored brake 2Z1 are detected in the work process. In addition, the overrun (distance/time characteristic) during the braking process (dynamic) and/or at start-up of the machine (static) is monitored with the aid of a displacement measurement system 1S1 on the piston rod. An accu- mulation of undetected faults may lead to loss of the safety function. • Testing of the safety function is implemented at suitable intervals, for example at least every eight working hours. • The test function must not be impaired by failure of the brake. Failure of the test function must not lead to failure of the brake. • Should trapped compressed air pose a further hazard, additional measures are required. Design features • Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. • The directional control valve 1V1 features a closed centre position with sufficient overlap and spring-centred central position. • The safety-oriented switching position is assumed from any position by cancellation of the control signal. • Signals from the pressure monitor 2S1 and the displacement measurement system 1S1 are processed for example in the upstream electrical logic (not shown). Calculation of the probability of failure • MTTF : B values of 20,000,000 cycles [S] are assumed for
