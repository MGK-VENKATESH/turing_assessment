Systems Connection systems add value by reducing the installation and maintenance costs of safety systems. Designs must take into account consideration of single channel, dual channel, dual channel with indication and multiple types of devices. When a series connection of dual channel interlocks is needed, a distribution block can simplify installation. With an IP67 rating, these types of boxes can be mounted on the machine at remote locations. When a diverse set of devices is required, an ArmorBlock Guard I/O box can be used. The inputs can be confi gured by software to accommodate various types of devices. 55 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery Chapter 5: Safety Distance Calculation Hazards must come to a safe state prior to an operator reaching the hazard. For the safety distance calculation, there are two groups of standards. In this chapter, these standards are grouped as follows: ISO EN: (EN ISO 13855) US CAN (ANSI B11.19, ANSI RIA R15.06 and CAN/CSA Z434-03) Formula The minimum safety distance is dependent on the time required to process the Stop command and how far the operator can penetrate the detection zone before detection. The formula used throughout the world has the same form and requirements. The differences are the symbols used to represent the variables and the units of measure. The formulas are: ISO EN: S = K x T + C US CAN: Ds = K x (Ts + Tc + Tr + Tbm) + Dpf Where: Ds and S are the minimum safe distance from the danger zone to the closest detection point Directions of Approach When considering the safety distance calculation where light curtains or an area scanner is used, the angle of approach to the detection device must be taken into consideration. Three types of approaches are considered: Normal
