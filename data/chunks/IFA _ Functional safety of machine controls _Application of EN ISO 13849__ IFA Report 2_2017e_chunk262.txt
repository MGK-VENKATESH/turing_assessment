to blocking of the start/stop signal and of servo enable on the inverter by both processing channels. 172 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS B1 G1 T1 K1 B2 G2 Q1 Design features • Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. Protective circuits (such as contact protection) as described in the initial paragraphs of Chapter 8 are implemented. • A stable arrangement of the safeguard is assured for actuation of the position switch. • The position switch B1 features direct opening action in accordance with IEC 60947-5-1, Annex K. The position switch B2 also complies with IEC 60947-5-1. • The contactor Q1 possesses a mirror contact in accordance with IEC 60947-4-1, Annex F. • The supply conductors to the position switches are laid either separately or with protection against mechanical damage. • For the “safely limited speed” safety function, a fault exclusion is assumed for the fault condition of encoder shaft breakage (G1/G2). Details of the possibility of a fault exclusion can be found for example in IEC 61800-5-2, Table D.8, and GS-IFA-M21. • The standard components G1 and G2 (where relevant for the rotary encoders) and T1 are employed in accordance with the information in subclause 6.3.10. • The safety component K1 satisfies all requirements for Category 3 and PL d. The software (SRASW) is programmed in accordance with the requirements for PL d and the information in subclause 6.3.10. • It is assumed that each output of the safety PLC is actuated by both processing channels of the PLC and that the analog output 03 is monitored by two channels. Calculation of the probability of failure • The SRP/CS is divided into the two subsystems sensor/actuator and PLC. For the PLC subsystem, a tested safety PLC suitable for PL d is
