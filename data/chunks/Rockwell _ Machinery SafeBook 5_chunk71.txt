19.9 in (505mm) Therefore, the minimum safe distance the safety light curtain must be mounted from the hazard is 20 inches or 508mm, for a machine to be used anywhere in the world. 59 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery Chapter 6: Safety Related Control Systems Introduction What is a safety related control system (often abbreviated to SRCS)? It is that part of the control system of a machine that prevents a hazardous condition from occurring. It can be a separate dedicated system or it may be integrated with the normal machine control system. Its complexity will vary from a simple system, such as a guard door interlock switch and emergency stop switch connected in series to the control coil of power contactor, to a compound system comprising both simple and complex devices communicating through software and hardware. Safety related control systems are designed to perform safety functions. The SRCS must continue to operate correctly under all foreseeable conditions. So what is a safety function; how do we design a system to achieve this; and when we have done that, how do we show it? Safety Function A safety function is implemented by the safety-related parts of the machine control system to achieve or maintain the equipment under control in a safe state with respect to a specifi c hazard or set of hazards. A failure of the safety function can result in an immediate increase of the risks of using the equipment; that is, a hazardous condition. A “hazardous condition” is when a person could be exposed to a hazard. A hazardous condition does not imply that the person is harmed. The exposed person may be able to acknowledge the hazard and avoid injury. The exposed person may not be able to recognize the hazard, or
