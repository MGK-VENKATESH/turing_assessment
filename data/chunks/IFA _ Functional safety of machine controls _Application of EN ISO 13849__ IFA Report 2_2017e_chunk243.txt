to direct monitoring of the position via 1S4 in K4. The averaging formula for DC produces a result of 93% avg (“medium”). • The logic and hydraulic control satisfies Category 2 with a high MTTF of each channel (94 years) and medium DC D avg (93%). This results in an average probability of dangerous failure PFH of 2.5 · 10-7 per hour. D • The average probability of dangerous failure of the safety function is produced by addition of the proportions for the MPC, the data communication and the logic and hydraulic control, yielding a PFH of 5.5 · 10-7 per hour. This D satisfies PL d. 154 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS More detailed references • ISO 15998: Earth-moving machinery – Machine control systems (MCS) using electronic components – Performance criteria and tests (04.08).
