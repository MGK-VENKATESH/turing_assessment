trend is for suppliers to provide machines with the safeguarding, as designing safety into a machine is far more cost effective than adding the safeguarding after the machine is designed and built. Standards are now attempting to get the supplier and user to communicate requirements for safeguarding so that machines are made not only safe but more productive. The Secretary of Labor has the authority to promulgate as an occupational safety or health standard any national consensus standard, and any established Federal standard, unless the promulgation of such a standard would not result in improved safety or health for specifi cally designated employees. OSHA accomplishes this task by publishing regulations in Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulation (29 CFR). Standards pertaining to industrial machinery are published by OSHA in Part 1910 of 29 CFR. They are freely available on the OSHA website at www.osha.gov. Unlike most standards, which are voluntary, the OSHA standards are laws. Some of the important parts as they pertain to machine safety are as follows: A - General B - Adoption and Extension of Established Federal Standards C - General Safety and Health Provisions H - Hazardous Materials I - Personal Protective Equipment J - General Environmental Controls - includes Lockout/Tagout O - Machinery and Machine Guarding R - Special Industries S - Electrical 14 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Regulations Some OSHA standards reference voluntary standards. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register. When a national consensus standard is incorporated by reference in one of the subparts, that standard has the ‘force of law’. For example, NFPA 70, a voluntary standard known as the US National Electric Code, is referenced in Subpart S. This makes the requirements in
