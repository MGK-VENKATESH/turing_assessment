Functional description • The multi-purpose control (MPC) S1 converts the operator‘s manual movement of it into electronic messages. It sends these messages cyclically over a serial data communications line (bus system) to the logic control. This generates control signals for the hydraulics, which in turn executes the working movements of the earth-moving machine desired by the operator. • The message 1 sent by the MPC S1 reaches the microcontroller K3 via the bus transceiver K1. From message 1 and in accordance with the algorithms stored in the software, K3 generates the analog signals required for actuation of the proportional valve 1V4. The resistances R1/R2 and the measuring amplifiers K6/K8 have the function of cont- rolling the output currents for the proportional valve. The
