The value of the speed constant is dependent on movements of the operator (i.e. hand speeds, walking speeds, and stride lengths). This parameter is based on research data showing that it is reasonable to assume a 1600mm/sec (63in/s) hand speed of an operator while the body is stationary. The circumstances of the actual application must be taken into account. As a general guideline, the approach speed will vary from 1600mm/s (63in/s) to 2500mm/sec (100in/s). The appropriate speed constant must be determined by the risk assessment. Stopping Time T is the overall stopping time of the system. The total time, in seconds, starts from the initiation of the stop signal to the cessation of the hazard. This time can be broken down to its incremental parts (Ts, Tc, Tr and Tbm) for easier analysis. Ts is the worst case stopping time of the machine/equipment. Tc is the worst case stopping time of the control system. Tr is the response time of the safeguarding device, including its interface. Tbm is additional stopping time allowed by the brake monitor before it detects stop-time deterioration beyond the end usersâ€™ predetermined limits. Tbm is used with part revolution mechanical presses. Ts + Tc + Tr are usually measured by a stop-time measuring device if the values are unknown. Depth Penetration Factors The Depth Penetration Factors is represented by the symbols C and Dpf. It is the maximum travel towards the hazard before detection by the safeguarding device. Depth penetration factors will change depending on the type of device and application. Check the relevant standard to
