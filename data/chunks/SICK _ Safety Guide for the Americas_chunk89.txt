The aperture angle of the lens is reduced as far as possible so that disturbance-free operation can even be ensured in the event of minor alignment errors. The same applies to the aperture angle of the receiver (effective aperture angle according to IEC 61496-2). But even for smaller aperture angles, there is the possibility for light beams from the sender to be deflected from reflective surfaces, thus leading to a failure to detect an object (see figures). Mutual interference impedes detection by the ESPE and
