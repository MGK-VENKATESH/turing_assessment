without notice 3D – VERIFYING THE SAFETY FUNCTION 3d – Verifying the safety function During verification, analyses and/or checks are carried out to demonstrate that the safety function meets the objectives and requirements of the specification in all aspects. Verification essentially involves the following: • Verification of physical guards • Verification of functional safety • Verification of the design of non-physical guards Verification of physical guards In the case of physical guards, the design must be checked to ascertain whether the devices meet requirements with regard to separation or distancing from hazardous points and/or requirements with regard to the restraining of ejected parts, hazardous substances or radiation. Particular attention should be paid to compliance with ergonomic requirements. This is to ensure that the protective device provides the protection that meets the requirements. Separating and/or distancing effect • Sufficient safety distance and dimensioning (reaching over, reaching under, etc.) • Suitable mesh size or grid spacing for fence elements • Sufficient rigidity and suitable mounting • Selection of suitable materials • Safe setup • Resistance to aging • Design of the guard prevents climbing on the guard Restraining of ejected parts, hazardous substances or radiation • Sufficient rigidity, impact resistance, fracture strength (retention) • Sufficient retention for the prevailing type of radiation, in particular where thermal hazards are concerned (heat, cold) • Suitable mesh size or grid spacing for fence elements • Sufficient rigidity and suitable mounting • Selection of suitable materials • Safe setup • Resistance to aging Ergonomic requirements • Suitable transparency (so that machine operation can be observed) • Setup, color, aesthetics • Handling (weight, actuation, etc.) Verification of non-physical guards Depending on the type of non-physical guard (safety light curtains, pressure sensitive mats, ...), different system‐ atic properties must be verified. The effectiveness of a non-physical guard can
