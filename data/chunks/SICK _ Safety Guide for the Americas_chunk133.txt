Determine the height of the hazardous point a and find the ence level (e.g., floor, working surface) and end at 1800 mm. value in the left-hand column, e.g., 1000 mm. If the height of the guard is to be 1600 mm, then the safety 2. In this row find the first column in which the horizontal dis- distance must be increased to at least 800 mm. tance C is less than the safety distance calculated, e.g., the first field with the value “0.” 3. Read the resulting height b for the guard in the bottom row, e.g., 1800 mm. ➜ Safety distances and required guard height: ANSI B11.19, RIA TR R15.406, CSA Z432, NR-12, ISO 13857 3-62 GUIDE FOR SAFE MACHINERY | SICK 7028282/2014-09-08 Subject to change without notice Risk reduction Safeguarding (technical protective measures) Minimum distance for fixed position protective devices Where: Example: Minimum distance for two-hand control • S is the minimum distance in millimeters measured from the control to the nearest hazardous point. • K is a parameter in millimeters per second, derived from the S = (K × T) + C data for the approach speeds of the body or parts of the
