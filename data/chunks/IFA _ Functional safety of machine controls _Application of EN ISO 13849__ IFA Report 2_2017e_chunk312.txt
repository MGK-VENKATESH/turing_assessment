Faults in the switches S1/S2 or in the contactor relays with mechanically linked readback contacts K3 to K6 are detected in the microcontrollers by cross monitoring. The functioning of 2V1/2V2 is monitored by means of the pressure switch 2S1. Since the microcontrollers perform self-tests in addition in the background during operation, internal faults and faults in the peripherals can be detected here in time. • All machine states are monitored and controlled by both microcontrollers. The cyclical nature of the cut operation causes all system states to be cycled through and compared with each other. Faults and deviations from defined intermediate states cause the machine to be halted at the latest upon completion of the cycle. This method is implied in the diagram by the signal “Feedback knife” B1 and the signal “Position monitoring” B2/B3 of the “Knife locking device” Q2. • Brake wear is monitored with the aid of the position switch B1. B1 is actuated and a further cut prevented by the control system in response to the slightest increase in the overrun. Design features • Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. Protective circuits as described in the initial paragraphs of Chapter 8 are implemented. • The actuators S1 and S2 of the two-hand control satisfy IEC 60947-5-1. 237 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS • B1 and B2 are position switches with direct opening action to IEC 60947-5-1, Annex K. • K3 to K6 possess mechanically linked contact elements to IEC 60947-5-1, Annex L. • The supply conductors to the position switches are laid either separately or with protection against mechanical damage. • The software of the homogeneously redundant microprocessor structure satisfies the requirements of IEC 61508-3, clause 7 for SIL 3. • A fault exclusion applies for the
