Alternatively, locks with interlocking mechanisms may be used to prevent access until the hazard is no longer present. Description of the parameters: S Hazardous area • S: Minimum distance in millimeters, measured from the nearest hazardous point to the nearest door opening point. • K: Parameter in millimeters per second, derived from the data for the approach speeds of the body or parts of the body, usually 1,600 mm/s. • T: Stopping/run-down time for the entire system in seconds. • C: Safety distance (s, see table 44). This is nec‐ r essary if it is possible to insert fingers or hands through the opening and towards the hazard zone before a stop signal is generated.
