loaded and unloaded cyclically. Conforming to the standards, PSDI mode can only be executed with type 4 AOPDs and an effective resolution d ≤ 30 mm. In PSDI mode, the machine waits at a defined position for a specified number of interruptions by the operator. The safety light curtain releases the dangerous movement again automatically after a specific number of interruptions. The ESPE has to be reset under the following conditions: • When the machine starts • On restart when the AOPD is interrupted within a dangerous movement • If no PSDI was triggered within the specified PSDI time It must be checked that no danger to the operator can arise during the work process. This limits the use of this operating mode on machines in which there is no possibility for whole body access and it is not possible for the operator to remain undetected between the protective field and the machine (presence detection). Single break PSDI mode means that the AOPD initiates the machine function after the operator has completed one intervention. Double break PSDI mode means that the AOPD holds the machine function in the locked state after the operator's first intervention (e.g., removal of a machined workpiece). Only after the operator has completed the second intervention (e.g., feeding in of a blank) does the safety light curtain release the machine function again. PSDI mode is often used on presses and stamps, but can also be used on other machines (e.g., rotating tables, automatic assembly systems). When using PSDI mode, it must not be possible to stand behind the light curtain. For presses, special conditions apply for PSDI mode.
