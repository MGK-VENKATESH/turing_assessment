ESPE is described in the ISO 13855 standard (type-B standard). General calculation formula S = (K × T) + C S Minimum distance in millimeters, measured from the nearest hazardous point to the detection zone of the ESPE. K Parameter in millimeters per second, derived from the data for the approach speeds of the body or parts of the body. T Stopping/run-down time for the entire system in seconds. C Additional distance in millimeters that represents the entry into the hazardous area before the protective device is triggered. Supplement determined by resolution C RT 8 × (d–14) Depending its detection capability (resolution), the ESPE may trigger (detect a person) when parts of the body have already passed the protective field. 94 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION This must be taken into account by adding the supplement determined by the resolution C (RT = Reach Through).

Protective devices that can be reached over Depending on the height and position of the protective field of an ESPE, the shape of the machine, and other factors, the protective field of an ESPE can be reached over to gain access to hazardous points before the hazardous machine functions have ceased and the intended protection is thereby not provided. The figure shows an example comparing an ESPE that cannot be reached over and an ESPE that can be reached over.
