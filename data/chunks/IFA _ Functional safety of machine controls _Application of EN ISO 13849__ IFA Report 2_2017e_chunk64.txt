Verification primarily Machinery Directive 2006/42/EC [2]. concerns completeness, correctness, intelligibility and freedom from contradictions. It is clearly advantageous 6.1.2 Systematic failures for verification to be performed, for example by way of an inspection, by a party not involved in the project.
