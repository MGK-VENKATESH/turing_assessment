Functional description • The hazardous movement is interrupted redundantly if either the stop button S1 or the protective device K3 – shown in the circuit diagram as electro-sensitive protective equipment (ESPE) – is activated. The drive is halted in an emergency following actuation of the emergency stop device S4. In all three cases, stopping is initiated via the output O3 of the PLC K4 by deactivation of the “Start/Stop” input on the frequency inverter (FI) T1. Redundantly to this process, the input “STO2” on T1 is deactivated by
