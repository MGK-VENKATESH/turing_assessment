includes explanation of the function in conjunction with the safety objectives that are to be attained. It is immaterial when the infor- mation for use of the SRP/CS passes review, including with regard to the following points: description of the intended use; statement of information on the PL and the Category (including dated reference to the stan- dard); explanation of all operating modes; description of the safeguards and safety functions with response times, environmental conditions for operation and external interfaces; information and technical data on transport, safe erection, commissioning and mainte- nance. Here too, the result of the review shall be recor- ded in writing. • Validation of the combination and integration of SRP/CS The safety function described is implemented by an SRP/CS. Since the different technologies, electronic and hydraulic, are however combined within this SRP/CS, certain tests that are necessary when SRP/CS are com- bined should also be performed here, unless they have already been included in validation of the Category. These tests include comparison of the interface data between the technologies employed, and functional tests and extended functional tests. 97 98 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS i Changes with respect to the second edition The description in each example is structured as follows: (BGIA Report 2/2008e): • Safety function • Example Nos 8, 26 and 36 deleted • Functional description • New example No 38 on hydraulic valve drive inserted • Design features • Substantially modified examples: Nos 17, 19 and 24 • Remarks • Calculation of the probability of failure • More detailed references This report began by addressing the design of safe con- trol systems in general terms. Subclauses 5.7, 6.5 and 7.6 Under “safety function”, the name of the safety function then illustrated, with reference to the example of a paper- is stated together with
