In the case of the 4-wire This design is more universal and offers more version, a circuit is short-circuited (a few Ohms). In the case of the resistance version, a advantages. As on a safety switch, a switch change from a set resistance (a few kOhms) is detected. These designs require more complex contact is opened on activation of the protec- evaluation. tive device. A short-circuit can be excluded by proper cabling or shielding. ➜ Requirements of pressure sensitive protective devices: ANSI B11.19, RIA TR R15.406, CSA Z432, ISO 13856 series (B-type standards) Foot switches (when not used for emergency stop) Foot switches are used to control work processes. On some Some international standards include additional requirements, machines (e.g., presses, punches, bending and metal working such as: machines) the use of foot switches for safety functions is only • A 3-position design similar to the enabling switch principle permitted in separate operating modes and only in conjunction (see “Principle of operation of the 3-position enabling with other technical protective measures (e.g., slow speed). device” - 3-40) However, in these cases, specific design requirements must be • A means of manual reset upon actuation of the actuator met: beyond the pressure point • A protective cover to
