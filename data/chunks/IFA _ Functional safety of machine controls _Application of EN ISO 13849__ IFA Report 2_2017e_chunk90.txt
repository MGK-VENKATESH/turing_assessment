with reference to Category formance of the safety function proper in the individual 2, however, a general guideline is that its MTTF should channels remains assured. D be at least half that of the individual (symmetrized, see below) channel, and consideration should also be given Definition of the blocks and channels goes hand-in-hand to systematic failures and CCF. with determining of the Category, and is the first step in quantification of the PL. Further values are required 6.2.9 Safety-related block diagram for this purpose: the evaluation of the component reli- ability (MTTF ), of the tests (DC ), and of the relevance D avg The safety-related block diagram is based upon the more of common cause failures (CCF). Further information on familiar reliability block diagram [33]. Common to both the journey “from the conceptual schematic diagram diagrams is the principle that the (safety) function may to the Performance Level”, specifically, on deriving the continue to be performed provided a chain of blocks safety-related block diagram, can be found in SISTEMA that have not failed dangerously remains intact from left Cookbook 1 [34]. This cookbook also introduces the term to right along the functional connecting lines. However, “encapsulated subsystem”. This refers to a subsystem the safety-related block diagram presents additional test for which the manufacturer already states the PL, PFH D mechanisms, such as the cross monitoring of redundant and Category, and the precise internal structure and channels, or tests performed by separate test units. A para meters of which are not transparent. These stated general example of a safety-related block diagram is parameters require observance of the conditions for use shown in Figure 6.9. specified by the manufacturer, which for example may 54 6 Design of safe control systems include the implementation of external diagnostics.
