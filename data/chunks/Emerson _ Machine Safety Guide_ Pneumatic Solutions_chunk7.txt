of a Control System) can, however, be such safety components, e.g. two-hand controls or logic units with safety function. Actuators (cylinders), energy supply (e.g. pressure supply or air preparation units) and connections are not directly factored into dangerous failure rates. ISO 13849 is the generic standard for safety components in controls.

Now we will look at the technical safety measures in greater detail. The question is to Procedure: what extent the safety function can reduce 1 Identify the hazardous situation (e.g. dangerous risk. After a prior risk estimation and the movements). definition of the required performance level (PL), the necessary degree of risk reduction is r determined. The following parameters determine whether the safety function actually mitigates risk to the required extent: • Control architecture (category) • Mean time to dangerous failure (MTTF ) D • Diagnostic coverage (DC) • Common cause failure (CCF) As a general rule: The performance level PL must at least correspond to the required PL. r
