basic safety principle. For protection against unexpected start-up after restoration of the power supply, the control system is provided with a latching. • S1 is a pushbutton with direct opening action to IEC 60947-5-1, Annex K. S1 is therefore considered as a well-tried component. • Contactor Q1 is a well-tried component in consideration of the additional conditions in accordance with Table D.3 of EN ISO 13849-2. • The braking device K1 is constructed entirely from simple electronic components such as transistors, capacitors, diodes resistors and thyristors. The safety-related behaviour is determined by the selection of the components. Internal measures for fault detection are not implemented. Application • On woodworking machines or comparable machines on which unbraked stopping would result in an impermissibly long run-down of the hazardous tool movements. The control of the braking function on woodworking machines must be designed such that at least PL b is achieved (prEN ISO 19085-1:2014). Calculation of the probability of failure • The pushbutton S1 and the contactor Q1 are combined for the calculation in SISTEMA to a subsystem that meets the requirements of Category 1. The braking device K1 forms a separate subsystem in Category B. • S1 is a pushbutton with direct opening action according to IEC 60947-5-1, Annex K. • MTTF : A B value of 20 · 106 switching cycles [M] is specified for the pushbutton S1. B value of 1,300,000 swit- D 10D 10D ching cycles [S] at nominal load is assumed for the contactor Q1. At 300 working days, 8 working hours and a cycle time of 2 minutes, n is 72,000 cycles per year. The MTTF is 2,777 years for the pushbutton S1 and 180 years for op D Q1. Together, this results to an MTTF of 169 years, which in accordance with the standard is
