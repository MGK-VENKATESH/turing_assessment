It is intended for designers and users of industrial equipment. In order to promote the concept of an open market within the European Economic Area (EEA) (which comprises all EU Member States plus three other countries) all member states are obliged to enact legislation that defi nes essential safety requirements for machinery and its use. Machinery that does not meet these requirements cannot be supplied into or within EEA countries. There are several European Directives that can apply to the safety of industrial machinery and equipment but the two that are of the most direct relevance are: 1 The Machinery Directive 2 The Use of Work Equipment by Workers at Work Directive These two Directives are directly related as the Essential Health and Safety Requirements (EHSRs) from the Machinery Directive can be used to confi rm the safety of equipment in the Use of Work Equipment Directive. This section deals with aspects of both directives and it is strongly recommended that anyone concerned
