Functional description • A hazard zone is safeguarded by means of a guard, opening of which is detected by a safety module K1. The safety module actuates a contactor Q2 and a combination comprising a contactor monitoring module F1 and an undervol- tage release Q1. The dropping-out of Q2 interrupts hazardous movements and prevents hazardous states from ari- sing. The contactor monitoring module F1 has the function of monitoring the main contacts of the contactor Q2 for contact welding. Should Q2 fail to drop out, F1 trips the upstream circuit-breaker or motor starter Q1 via the latter‘s undervoltage release. The circuit-breaker or motor starter then switches off the motor. • The safety function is preserved in the event of a component failure. • An accumulation of faults between two successive actuations can lead to loss of the safety function. 210 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS Q2 K1 F1 Q1 Design features • The circuit-breaker Q1 is checked regularly by means of a test function that is to be implemented manually. The interval between the tests should
