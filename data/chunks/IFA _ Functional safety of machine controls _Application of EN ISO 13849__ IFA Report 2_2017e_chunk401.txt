Only where appro- tion. The appropriate DC level depends on the overlap priate independence is assured (single-fault tolerance, of the commonly used resources (logic, inputs/outputs resistance to common cause failures) between the testing etc.). E.g. when all faults of a rotary encoder on a printing and tested units, however, is a test actually effective. It machine lead to highly visible interruption of the printing is also important that the safe state is actually assumed process, the DC for this sensor used to monitor a safely following detection of a dangerous failure. If, for example, limited speed may be estimated as 90% up to 99%.” For
