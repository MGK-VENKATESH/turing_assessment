The diagram is intended to show whether function, or diagnostics functions in the event of failures, the safety function is executed in whole or part by a sin- they must always be considered in a function block. For gle-channel or multi-channel solution, and the available example, components for assurance of electromagnetic diagnostics by which internal component failures can be compatibility (EMC) must be examined with regard to detected. Since – with regard to the aspect of relevance whether their failure, for example short-circuiting of a here, i.e. quantification of the probabilities of failure – capacitor, has negative effects upon safety-related cir- diagnostics represents a means of compensating for com- cuits. ponent failures, the term “failure detection” will be used in this Annex in place of the usual term “fault detection”. Parts of circuits with defined inputs and outputs may be regarded as a function block. In order to keep the In the field of machine safety, it is generally accepted number of required function blocks as low as possible, that in the event of a control-system failure, a substitute parts of circuits that are arranged functionally in series, response should occur in place of the safety function i.e. circuits that execute different signal processing steps originally implemented, and that the substitute reaction sequentially, can be grouped to form a function block. Blocks differing from this arrangement should logically 2 The FMEA described here also considers the detection of fai- be grouped only to the extent that redundancies such as lures (diagnostics), and can therefore also be termed FMEDA separate shut-off paths and the mutual diagnostics of (failure mode, effects and
