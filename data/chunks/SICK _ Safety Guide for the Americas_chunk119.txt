the positioning of the AOPD. type of safeguarding is also often implemented using AOPDDR With an installation height of 500 mm, an AOPD with a resolu- (laser scanners). However, supplements have to be added for tion less than or equal to 83.33 mm shall be used. It must not these devices for technology-related reasons.

AOPD resolution = S = (1600 m to m tal /s x 0.16 s) + (1200 mm - (0.4 x 500) mm) 80 mm S = 1256 mm H=500 mm Floor C = additional distance (instrusion factor) in millim eters that H = installation height represents entry
