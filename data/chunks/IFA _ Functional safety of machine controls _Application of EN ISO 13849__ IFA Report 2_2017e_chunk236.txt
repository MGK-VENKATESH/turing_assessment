Functional description • The laser scanner F1 monitors, with its detection zone, the area in which movement of the cylinder 1A may present a danger to the operator. The output signal of the laser scanner is read in on two channels by the safety PLC K1. Following any violation of the detection zone, the next movement must be enabled by actuation of a start button S1 evaluated in K1 (restart interlock). K1 controls the movement of 1A with the aid of the hydraulic part of the control system. • The hydraulic part of the control system comprises a two-channel arrangement. The first channel comprises direc- tional control valve 1V3, which acts upon the pilot-operated non-return valve 1V4. In the closed position, 1V4 blocks movements of 1A. The second channel consists of the directional control valve 1V5, which in its closed centre posi- tion also prevents movement of 1A. • 1V5 is actuated cyclically in the process. 1V3 and 1V4 close only in the event of violation of the detection zone (demand of the safety function), but at least once per shift. • Direct position monitoring 1S3 is implemented on 1V4 and evaluated in K1 as a fault detection measure.
