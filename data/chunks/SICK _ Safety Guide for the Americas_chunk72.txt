the description of the system performance. Category B/Category 1 Category B/1 Normal operation Operation with fault Simple/single channel 3 Protective field Free No fault detection. The occurrence of a Occupied c fault will result in a risk. Time The risk can be minimized with reliable and proven components (Category 1). Risk On Signal output Off Category 2 Category 2 Normal operation Operation with fault Single channel with monitoring Free Protective field Faults are detected by carrying out a Occupied test. A risk prevails during the time be- Test cycle tween the occurrence of the fault and the next test. The test rate according to ISO 13849-1 shall be considered. Risk On Signal output Off Category 3 Category 3 Normal operation Operation with fault Dual channel with monitoring (Control reliable) Free Protective field Occupied In the event of a fault, the safety func- tion is retained. The failure is detected either when the On 1 safety function is executed or when the Off Signal outputs next test is carried out. An accumula- On 2 tion of faults may lead to the loss of the Off safety function. 3-16 GUIDE FOR SAFE MACHINERY | SICK 7028282/2014-09-08 Subject to change without notice Risk reduction Safeguarding (technical protective measures) Category 4 Category 4 Normal operation Operation with fault Dual channel with multiple fault Free monitoring (Control reliable) Protective field Occupied Despite a fault, the safety function is retained. On Contrary to Category 3, consequential 1 Off faults following failure to detect the ini- Signal outputs 2 On tial fault shall not result in a risk (loss Off of the safety function). Characteristics of safeguarding Characteristics of safeguarding to be considered are: The following sections describe these points in detail. • Properties and applications of guards and protective devices (electro-sensitive, separating, etc. g 3-18) •
