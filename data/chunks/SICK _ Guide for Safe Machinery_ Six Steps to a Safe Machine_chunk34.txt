of operators. Power isolation to prevent unexpected start-up When working on the machine (maintenance, cleaning, servicing, etc.), a machine start or the restoration of power shall not result in a hazard for the persons involved. When mains disconnection devices are used, means shall be provided to prevent unintentional and/or mistaken switching of the power supply isolation device. This can be achieved, for example, by blocking the main switch in the “OFF” position with a padlock. NOTE This power isolation device is not suitable for use as a protective measure for brief interventions into the hazard‐ ous area for operational purposes. Protection against electric shock Protection classes The classification into different protection classes describes the means by which single-fault safety is achieved. This categorization does not provide an indication of the level of protection. Table 8: Symbols and explanations of protection classes Protection class I All devices with simple insulation (basic insulation) and a protective conduction connection are in protection class I. The protective conductor must be connected to a terminal marked with the earthing symbol or PE and be green-yellow. Protection class II Equipment in protection class II has increased insulation or double insulation and is not connected to the protec‐ tive conductor. This protective measure is also known as protective insulation. There shall be no connection of a protective conductor. Protection Class III Equipment in protection class III operates with a safety extra-low voltage and, therefore, does not require any explicit protection. Safety extra-low voltage SELV/PELV AC voltages up to 50 volts (V ) and DC voltages up to 120 volts are allowed as safety extra-low voltages. Above RMS 75 volts DC, the requirements of the Low Voltage Directive must also be observed. 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 33 Subject to change without notice
