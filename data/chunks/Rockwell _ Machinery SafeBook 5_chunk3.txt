with the design, supply, purchase or use of industrial equipment within or into the EEA and also certain other European countries should familiarize themselves with their requirements. Most suppliers and users of machinery will simply not be allowed to supply or operate machinery in these countries unless they conform to these directives. There are other European Directives that may have relevance to machinery. Most of them are fairly specialized in their application and are therefore left outside the scope of this section but it is important to note that, where relevant, their requirements must also be met. Examples are: The EMC Directive 2014/30/EC and the ATEX Directive 2014/34/EU. 2 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Regulations The Machinery Directive The Machinery Directive covers the supply of new machinery and other equipment including safety components. It is an offense to supply machinery within the EU unless the provisions and requirements of the Directive are met. The broadest defi nition of “machinery” given within the Directive is a follows: an assembly, fi tted with or intended to be fi tted with a drive system other than directly applied human or animal effort, consisting of linked parts or components, at least one of which moves, and which are joined together for a specifi c application The current Machinery Directive (2006/42/EC) replaced the former version (98/37/EC) at the end of 2009. It clarifi es and amends but does not introduce any radical changes to its Essential Health and Safety Requirements (EHSRs). It does introduce some changes to take account of changes in technology and methods. It extends its scope to cover some extra types of equipment CE marking affi xed to machine (e.g. construction site hoists). There is now an explicit requirement for a risk assessment for the determination of which EHSRs are applicable and there are
