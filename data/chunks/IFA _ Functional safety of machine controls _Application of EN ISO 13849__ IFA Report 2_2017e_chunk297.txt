Further SRP/CS (e.g. safeguards and electrical logic elements) must be added in the form of subsystems for completion of the safety function. 214 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS 1V1 1V2 1S1 1S2 Functional description • A hazardous movement of the cylinder is controlled redundantly by the valves 1V1 and 1V2. The movements can be halted either by the directional control valve 1V1 or 1V2. • Failure of one of these valves alone does not result in loss of the safety function. • Should at least one of the control signals be cancelled, the piston side of the cylinder is vented. • A single valve fault is detected by the integral position monitoring function when the control signal is cancelled; following a fault, initiation of the next hazardous movement is prevented. Design features • Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. • 1V1 and 1V2 are directional control valves with sufficient overlap, spring-return and electrical position monitoring. • Cancellation of the control signals places the valve in the safety-oriented switching position. • Signal processing by the electrical position monitoring function satisfies the relevant requirements for the control of failures. Calculation of the probability of failure • MTTF : a B value of 20,000,000 cycles [M] is assumed for the directional control valves. At 240 working days, D 10D 16 working hours and a cycle time
