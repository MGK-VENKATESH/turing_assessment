application subclause 5.1 of EN ISO 13849-1 and adds examples of of the holding brake in the rest position possible applications. The “emergency stop function” is also included: though not part of a safeguard, it is used b) Prevention of a crushing point being caused by for implementation of a complementary protective meas- descending machine parts ure (see subclause 5.5). Table 5.2 shows further safety functions for safe power drive systems to IEC 61800-5-2 c) Reduction of the power of a cutting laser where the eye (PDS/SR, power drive systems/safety related) [20]. The is directly exposed scope of this standard includes the safety functions fre- quently employed for prevention of unexpected start-up d) Prevention of dropping of the shaft in setup mode (safe torque off, STO), for safe stop SS1 and SS2 and for safely-limited speed (SLS). e) Evasion of the robot when a person enters its danger zone Safety functions for pneumatic drive technology are described in VDMA Technical Rule 24584 [21]. Table 5.1: Safety functions described in EN ISO 13849-1 Safety function Example application Safety-related stop function, initiated by a safeguard Response to tripping of a protective device with STO, SS1 or SS2 (Table 5.2) Manual reset function Acknowledgement when areas behind the protective device are vacated Start/restart function Permissible only with interlocking guards with start function to EN ISO 12100 Local control function Control of machine movements from a location within the hazard zone Muting function Temporary deactivation of safeguards, e.g. during material transport Hold-to-run equipment (inching switch) Machine movements controlled from a position within the hazard zone, e.g. during setup Enabling function Machine movements controlled from a position within the hazard zone, e.g. during setup Prevention of unexpected start-up Manual operator intervention in hazard zones Escape and rescue of trapped persons Separation of rollers Isolation and
