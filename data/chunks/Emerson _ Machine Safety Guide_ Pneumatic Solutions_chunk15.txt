types of failures are listed in Annex F of ISO 13849-1 with associated point scores. Only the entire number of points or none at all can be received for each of the measures listed. If a measure is partially met, zero points are assigned. Component manufacturers cannot provide any information related to CCF, because most measures are determined by the design of the machine.
