is determined by the detection capability (resolution) of the Europe / International: ESPE and is referred to as C (reach through). If it is pos- S = (K x T) + C RT sible to reach over the protective field of the ESPE, the addi- tional distance is determined by the height of the protective field and is referred to as C (reach over). RO 3 The table on pages 3-46 and 3-47 contains the formulas for NOTE: The resolution value d is also referred to as S or O in c s the calculation of the factors to consider for determining the North American standards. For the examples in the table, the minimum distance, where: variable d will be used exclusively. • ß is the angle between the detection plane and the ap- proach direction • H is the height of the protective field (detection plane) above the working surface • d is the resolution of the ESPE (detection capability) 7028282/2014-09-08 GUIDE FOR SAFE MACHINERY | SICK 3-45 Subject to change without notice Safeguarding (technical protective measures) Risk reduction North America (based on ANSI B11.19, RIA TR R15.406, and CSA Z432) Europe / International (based on ISO 13855 and NR-12) Detection § capability, d Detection capability, d Beam height, H Intrusion Minimum Beam height, H Intrusion Minimum Approach (resolution/ Depth of field (resolution/object (distance from floor) Factor, D Distance (distance from floor) Factor, C Distance object pf sensitivity) sensitivity) Perpendicular: ß = 90° (±5°) S = (K x ∑ T ) + C total S Hazard zone Finger/hand Calculation of the minimum Calculation of the minimum height of the high- where K = 2000 mm/s.
