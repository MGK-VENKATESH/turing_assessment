These requirements relate to: • the safety level of the safety-related parts of the control system (SRP/CS) • the avoidance of inadmissible conditions or inad‐ missible reconfigurations • the activation, as well as the conditions for initiat‐ ing the automatic mode of the machine • the state to be adopted when a fault is detected • the necessary conditions for selecting the protec‐ tive field • the installation and the organizational measures When applications with simultaneous field evalua‐ tions are implemented, the number of switchovers is reduced. The design is greatly simplified.
