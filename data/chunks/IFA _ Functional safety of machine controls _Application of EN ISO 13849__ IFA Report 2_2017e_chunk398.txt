For calculation of the DC, for example in conjunc- detection in the process tion with an FMEA (failure mode and effects analysis, see Annex B), the ratio is calculated of the totals of the failure rates λ and λ of the unit under consideration. The DC is DD D The diagnostic coverage DC is a measure of the effec- seen here to be a value relating to the tested unit (e.g. the tiveness of a control system's self-test and monitoring block) and not to the test equipment. In order to simplify measures. It may relate to individual components, blocks, calculation of the DC, EN ISO 13849-1 offers an alternative or entire subsystems (DC ). The precise definition of the solution to the FMEA: it proposes DC key values for typi- avg DC is based upon the division of failures into three groups cal diagnostics measures, the attainment of which may (see Figure E.1): be assumed when the relevant measure is implemented correctly.
