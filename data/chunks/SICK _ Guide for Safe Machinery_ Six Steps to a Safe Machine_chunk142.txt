according to ISO 13849-1", page 132): Calculation of the perform‐ ance level based on the PFH values of the subsystems. (This method is only described indirectly in the D standard). More realistic performance levels than those using the simplified method can be determined by applying the detailed method. For both methods, structural and systematic aspects relating to the achievement of the perform‐ ance level must also be taken into account in addition to the quantitative assessments. NOTE - More information about validation: ISO 13849-2 - You will find a large amount of information on verification using ISO 13849-1 at www.dguv.de/ifa/13849 Simplified procedure according to ISO 13849-1 This method also allows the overall PL for many applications to be estimated with sufficient accuracy without knowing individual PFH values. If the PL of all subsystems is known, the overall PL achieved by a safety function D can be determined using the following table. This method is based on mean values within the PFH value ranges for the different PLs. Therefore, using the D detailed method (see next section) may deliver more accurate results.
