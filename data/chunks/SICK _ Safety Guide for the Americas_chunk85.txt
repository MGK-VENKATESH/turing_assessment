use of an ESPE instead of (mechanical) guards (covers, safety fencing, etc.) is 3 advantageous thanks to: c • Reduced access time (operator does not have to wait for the guard to open) • Increased productivity (time savings when loading the machine) • Improved workplace ergonomics (operator does not have to operate a guard) In addition, operators and others alike are protected. Against what hazards does electro-sensitive protective equipment not protect? Since an electro-sensitive protective equipment does not rep- resent a physical barrier, it is not able to protect people against emissions such as ejected machine parts, workpieces or chips; Examples of optoelectronic protective devices ionizing radiation; heat (thermal radiation); noise; sprayed coolant and lubricant; etc. Similarly, ESPE cannot be used on An optoelectronic protective device can be used if the op- machines on which long stopping/run-down times require mini- erator is not exposed to any danger of injury due to ejected mum distances that cannot be achieved. parts (e.g., splashes of molten material). In such cases, guards must be used. 7028282/2014-09-08 GUIDE FOR SAFE MACHINERY | SICK 3-27 Subject to change without notice Safeguarding (technical protective measures) Risk reduction Safety light curtains and photoelectric switches (AOPDs) AOPDs with a smaller detection capability (40 mm or less ac- AOPDs are protective devices that use optoelectronic transmis- cording to international standards, and 64 mm or less for North sion and reception elements to detect persons in a defined American standards) are called safety light curtains and are § two-dimensional area. A series of parallel light beams (normally used to safeguard hazardous points directly (see figure). infrared) transmitted from the sender to the receiver form a protective field that safeguards the hazard zone. Detection occurs when an opaque object fully interrupts one or more beams. The receiver signals the beam interruption by
