in diverse functional channels of Category 3 or 4. Based on the applicable case, it is then possible to identify the mandatory and recommended individual measures in two tables. Part two of the new Annex N demonstrates software validation through analysis and testing, using the example of an SRASW based on validated function blocks. The example of the SRESW implementation in the informative Appendix J has been adapted to the current V model of the software safety lifecycle. The previous subsections on the verification of the achieved performance level and on ergonomic aspects of the design have become sections 8 and 9 without any major changes. 8 Section 10: Validation The new section 10, Validation, has been taken over entirely from sections 4 to 12 of EN ISO 13849-2. Except for some restructuring, the content and the requirements have essentially remained unchanged. They follow familiar patterns in dealing with validation principles, including a validation plan, validation protocol and validation through analysis and testing. Validation primarily concerns the specification of safety requirements as well as safety functions, safety integrity (effectiveness of safety functions), including categories, hardware, software as well as requirements on the operating environment and user information. The overview of the validation process makes it clear that, irrespective of the category, at least a functional test of the safety functions is required in addition to the analysis. By using the validation requirements from the less familiar part 2 of the standard, the aim is to emphasise validation as an important measure against faulty specifications, faulty design and faulty Fourth Edition of EN ISO 13849-1 (July 2023) 8 / 12 implementation, and to reinforce their practical implementation. In the long term, after a revision of part 2 of the standard â€“ a revision that will be limited to the tables and
