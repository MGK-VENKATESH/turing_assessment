This result is confirmed by the EN ISO 11111-6 product standard. The standards commit- tee evidently saw no reason to deviate from this owing to the incidence and severity of accidents.

High operating speeds and rotational speeds of the cylinders are reached, parti- cularly in newspaper printing. Essential hazards exist at the entrapment points of the counter-rotating cylinders. This example considers the hazard zone on a printing press on which maintenance work requires manual inter- vention at reduced machine speeds. The access to
