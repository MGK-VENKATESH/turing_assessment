Given that the MTTF is already D D to MTTF values simply by formation of the reciprocal. capped to 100 years (2,500 years in the case of Category D Based upon this relationship, the MTTF value of a block 4) for each channel involved, assignment of the MTTF D D can easily be derived from the MTTF values of its com- values to one of the three classes, “low”, “medium” or D ponents. An example of application of the parts count “high”, is expedient only after symmetrization.
