here, in the form of a subsystem. Further SRP/CS (e.g. safeguards and electrical logic elements) must be added in the form of subsystems for completion of the safety function. 132 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS 1V1 1S1 K1 0V1 Functional description • Hazardous movements are controlled by a directional control valve 1V1. • Failure of the directional control valve 1V1 between functional tests may result in loss of the safety function. The failure is dependent upon the reliability of the directional control valve. • Testing of the safety function is forced via the PLC K1 by means of a displacement measurement system 1S1. Testing takes place at suitable intervals and in response to a demand of the safety function. Detection of failure of 1V1 leads to the exhaust valve 0V1 being switched off. • Interruption of the hazardous movement by means of the exhaust valve 0V1 generally results in a longer overrun. The distance from the hazard zone must be selected in consideration of the longer overrun. • The test function must not be impaired by failure of the directional control valve. Failure of the test function must not lead to failure of the directional control valve. • Should trapped compressed air pose a further hazard, additional measures are required. Design features • Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. • 1V1 is a directional control valve with closed centre position, sufficient overlap and spring-centred central position. • The safety-oriented switching position is attained by cancellation of the control signal. • Testing may for example take the form of checking of the time/distance characteristic (displacement measurement system 1S1) of the hazardous movements in conjunction with the switching position of the directional control valve, with evaluation in a PLC (K1). • K1 must
