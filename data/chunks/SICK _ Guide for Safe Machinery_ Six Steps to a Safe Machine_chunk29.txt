the machine. • During the risk assessment, take into account in particular reasonably foreseeable misuse and malfunctions. • Then identify the hazards (mechanical, electrical, thermal,etc.) derived from the operation of the machine. Take into account these hazards in all life phases of the machine. • Then estimate the risks derived from the hazards. These depend on the extent of harm and the probability of occurrence of the harm. • Document the results of your risk assessment. 28 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice RISK REDUCTION STRATEGY Risk reduction strategy If the risk assessment shows that measures are required to reduce the risk, the 3-step method shall be used. The 3-step method The machine manufacturer must apply the following principles in the specified order when selecting risk reduction measures: 1 Safe design: elimination or minimization of residual risks as far as possible (integration of safety in the design and construction of the machine) 2 Technical protective measures: Take the necessary protective measures against risks that cannot be elimi‐ nated by design 3 Information for use about residual risks Safe design End or next Start (inherently safe design) hazard Has the risk Yes been reasonably reduced?
