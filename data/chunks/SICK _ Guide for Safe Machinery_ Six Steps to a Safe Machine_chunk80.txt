a protective device. This is necessary when material must be moved through the protective field of the protective device without stopping the work routine (hazardous state of the machine). It can also be used effectively to optimize the work rou‐ tine if allowed by certain machine states (e.g., muting the function of a safety light curtain during the non-haz‐ ardous upwards movement of a press die, making it easier for the operator to remove workpieces). Muting shall only be possible if the access to the haz‐ ardous point is blocked by the passing material. If it is not possible to stand behind (or pass through) detec‐ tion areas, muting shall only be possible if the machine functions still taking place are not dangerous (e.g., non- dangerous upward stroke of a press). This status is determined by muting sensors or signals. For the muting function, great care is necessary when Figure 59: Muting function with safety light curtain and mut‐ selecting and positioning the muting sensors and con‐ ing sensors on a wrapping machine troller signals used. The following conditions shall be met to implement a safe, standardized muting function: • During muting, a safe state must be ensured by other means, therefore it shall not be possible to access the hazardous area. • Muting shall be automatic, i.e., not manual. • Muting shall not be dependent on a single electrical signal. • Muting shall not be entirely dependent on software signals. • An invalid combination or sequence of muting signals shall not allow any muting state, and it shall be ensured that the protective function is retained. • The muting status shall end immediately after the material has passed through. To improve the quality of differentiation, additional limits, interlockings, or signals can be used including: • Direction of movement of
