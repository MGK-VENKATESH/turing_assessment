Standard EN ISO 12100-1 specifies all relevant potential hazards in production that may result in injury to people or animals, or damage to property. Hazards are divided into different categories, as shown in the diagram below. Our focus is especially geared toward safe machine shut-down, safe valve exhaust, and safe pressure release in pneumatic systems and components – precisely because these mechanical hazards can result in personal injury. Radiation hazard: Radiation: frequency, radiation: light, X-ray and gamma rays … Mechanical hazards: Crushing, clipping, cutting or shearing, catching or wrapping, pulling in or trapping, impact, Substances, materials: puncture, abrasion, fluids under pressure Contact or inhalation of dangerous substances, fire, explosion, virus, bacteria Electrical hazards: Direct or indirect contact, high voltage, Ergonomics: electrostatic processes, thermal radiation Posture, exertion, anatomy, protective or particles Hazards acc. to equipment, lighting, stress, insufficient challenges, human behavior, actuators, Thermal hazards: EN ISO 12100 visual indicators, displays Burns, frostbite Combination Noise hazards: of hazards Loss of hearing, disequilibrium, disturbance in speech Vibration-related hazards: Tripping, slipping, Vibration: handheld tools, falling hazards full-body vibration Basic conditions| Machine safety 9 Risk analysis: Risk estimation – Performance level Risk reduction measures are derived based on the severity of possible injury, the frequency of the hazard, and the probability of its occurrence. Performance level is a technical target: it conveys the effort required to reduce risk at a machine. The target must be met as a minimum requirement. Every safety function has a required safety level. This is described by the required performance level, PLr for short, which is defined based on the following criteria from ISO 13849-1: S Severity
