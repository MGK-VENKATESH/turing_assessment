of the following measures must be used: • Identification of the active emergency stop control switches through a color change by means of illumination • Covering the inactive emergency stop control switches, if possible automatically • Provision of suitable storage for the inactive operator panels Emergency switching off (switching off in an emergency situation - IEC 60204-1) Provision should be made for emergency switching off if there is a possibility of hazards or damage caused by electrical energy. The incoming electrical energy supply should be switched off by electromechanical switching devices. 92 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION It shall not be possible to switch on the incoming energy supply until all emergency off commands have been reset. The emergency switching off is achieved with stop category 0 ("Stopping", page 35). NOTE - Design guidelines for emergency stop devices: ISO 13850 (type-B standard) - Emergency shutdown: Machinery Directive 2006/42/EC Positioning and sizing of protective devices It must be ensured that the dangerous state can be eliminated in good time before the hazardous point is reached. This requires the protective device to be positioned at the required minimum distance from the hazardous point. The necessary minimum distance also depends on the properties of the protective device. This can also affect the selection of the optimal protective device.
