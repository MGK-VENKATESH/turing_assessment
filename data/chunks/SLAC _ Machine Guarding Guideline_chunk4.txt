to be actuated by the operator during emergency situations, proper position is critical. 2.3.3 Safety Tripwire Cable A safety tripwire cable is a device located around the perimeter of or near the danger area. Operator must be able to reach the cable to stop the machine. Tripwire cables must be manually reset to restart the machine. 19 July 2021 SLAC-I-730-0A21T-016-R003 7 of 12 SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory Environment, Safety & Health Division Machine and Portable Tools | Machine Safeguarding Guideline 2.3.4 Two-hand Control A two-hand control requires constant, concurrent pressure to activate the machine. This kind of control requires a part-revolution clutch, brake, and a brake monitor if used on a power press. The operator’s hands are required to be at a safe location (on control buttons) and at a safe distance from the danger area while the machine completes its closing cycle. 2.3.5 Two-hand Trip A two-hand trip requires concurrent application of both of the operator’s control buttons to activate the machine cycle, after which the hands are free. This device is used with machines equipped with full- revolution clutches. The trips must be placed far enough from the point of operation to make it impossible for the operators to move their hands from the trip buttons or handles into the point of operation before the first half of the cycle is completed to prevent them from being accidentally placed in the danger area prior to the slide/ram or blade reaching the full down position. 19 July 2021 SLAC-I-730-0A21T-016-R003 8 of 12 SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory Environment, Safety & Health Division Machine and Portable Tools | Machine Safeguarding Guideline 2.3.6 Gate Gates are movable barriers that protect the operator at the point of operation before the machine cycle text can be started. Gates are, in many instances, designed to
