- Explosion prevention and protection - Part 1: Basic concepts and methodology - Standard: EN IEC 60079-0 Explosive atmospheres - Part 0: Equipment - General requirements Summary: Safe design Mechanics, electronics, operation • The most effective and important measure is safe design to prevent hazards from occurring in the first place. • Design so that the operators are exposed to the hazardous area as little as possible. • Avoid dangers produced directly due to electrical power (direct and indirect contact) or produced indirectly due to faults in the control system. Stopping • Plan a control device for stopping the machine in normal operation. EMC • Design machines that meet applicable EMC requirements. The components used must be selected and verified so as to meet the following criteria: Comply with electromagnetic disturbance limits to not interfere with other equipment or devices ° Ensure immunity to the expected disturbances ° Comply with limit values for the area of application ° 40 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 3 – TECHNICAL PROTECTIVE MEASURES 3 – Technical protective measures A technical protective measure is implemented by means of one or more safety functions. Each safety function comprises at least one protective device. There are three types of protective devices: • Mechanical protective devices that retain parts, substances, or radiation or permanently prevent entry/ access. • Protective devices that are integrated into the controller of the machine to initiate the safe state as soon as persons or parts of the human body are detected. • Protective devices that are integrated into the controller of the machine to initiate the safe state as soon as the monitored safety-related limits of machine parameters (position, speed, force, etc.) are exceeded. All these protective devices implement safety functions, but not
