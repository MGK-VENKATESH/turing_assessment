and are produced by the European Standardization Organizations CEN and CENELEC. Their use is voluntary but designing and manufacturing equipment to them is the most direct way of demonstrating compliance with the EHSRs of the Machinery Directive. They are divided into 3 types: A, B and C standards. Type A. STANDARDS: Cover aspects applicable to all types of machines. Type B. STANDARDS: Subdivided into 2 groups. Type B1 STANDARDS: Cover particular safety and ergonomic aspects of machinery. Type B2 STANDARDS: Cover safety components and protective devices. Type C. STANDARDS: Cover specifi c types or groups of machines. It is important to note that complying with a C Standard gives automatic presumption of conformity with the EHSRs covered by that standard. In the absence of a suitable C Standard, A and B Standards can be used as part or full proof of EHSR conformity by pointing to compliance with relevant sections. Agreements have been reached for cooperation between CEN/CENELEC and bodies such as ISO and IEC. This should ultimately result in common worldwide standards. In most cases an EN Standard has a counterpart in IEC or ISO. In general the two texts will be the same and any regional differences will be given in the forward of the standard.

The mandatory provisions (e.g., the word shall implies mandatory) of the standards, incorporated by reference, have the same force and effects as the standards listed in Part 1910. For example, the national consensus standard NFPA 70 is listed as a reference document in Appendix A of Subpart S-Electrical of Part 1910 of
