been applied to prevent it. Safety switches, position switches, and interlocking devices The commonly used term "safety switch" does not appear in the standards because the multitude of technologies and suitable sen- sor designs for interlocking devices does not allow general requirements to be defined. Regardless of the technology used (mechanical, electrical, pneumatic, hydraulic), the following definitions apply: • An interlocking device consists of an actuator and a position switch. • A position switch consists of an actuating element and an output signal element. Depending on the technology of the position switch used and the functional safety requirements, either one or more interlocking devices will be required for a guard. 7028282/2014-09-08 GUIDE FOR SAFE MACHINERY | SICK 3-21 Subject to change without notice Safeguarding (technical protective measures) Risk reduction Mechanical attachment Reliable mechanical attachment of the position switches and • They must be arranged, installed, and mounted so that they actuators is crucial for their effectiveness.
