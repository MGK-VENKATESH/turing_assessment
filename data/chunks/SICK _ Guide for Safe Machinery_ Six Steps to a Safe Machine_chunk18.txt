To provide harmonized health and safety in the European Community and to remove trade barriers, the European standards are adopted by the national standardization organizations. The following principles apply to the relationship between national and safety standards: • If similar national standards exist for adopted European standards, the national standards shall be with‐ drawn. • If no applicable European standards exist for specific aspects or machinery, existing national standards can be applied. • A national standardization organization is only allowed to draft a new national standard if this intention has been announced and there is no interest at European level (at CEN or CENELEC). European standards for machinery safety Standards that describe the requirements of European directives in concrete detail in such a way that compliance with the standards provides presumption of conformity with the directives are referred to as “harmonized stand‐ ards”. The status of the standard is indicated by various abbreviations: • A standard with the prefix “EN” is recognized and can be applied in all EU states. • A standard with the prefix “prEN” is currently in preparation. • A document that also has “TS” as a prefix is a technical specification and is used as a preliminary standard. These documents exist as CLC/TS or as CEN/TS. • A document that also has “TR” as a prefix is a report on the state of the art. A harmonized European standard is prepared as follows: 1. The EU Commission, as the executive organ of the EU, issues a mandate to CEN or CENELEC to draft a European standard to specify in detail the requirements of a directive. 2. The preparatory work is undertaken in international technical committees in which the technical specifica‐ tions to meet the essential safety requirements in the
