Minimum distance for ESPE dependent upon approach The consideration of the minimum distance applies to ESPE with two-dimensional protective field (e.g., light curtains, photoelectric switches (AOPD), laser scanners (AOPDDR), or two-dimensional camera systems). In general, a differentiation is made between three different approach types.
