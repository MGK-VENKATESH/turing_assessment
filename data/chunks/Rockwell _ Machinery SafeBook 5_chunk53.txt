the relay and how far away the input devices can be mounted. For example, a safety relay may have a maximum allowable input impedance of 500 ohms. When the input impedance is greater than 500 ohms, it will not switch on its outputs. Care must be taken by the user to ensure that the input impedance remains below the maximum specifi cation. The length, size and type of wire used affects input impedance. Number of Input Devices The risk assessment process should be used to help determine how many input devices should be connected to a monitoring safety relay unit MSR and how often the input devices should be checked. To assure that emergency stops and gate interlocks are in an operational state, they should be checked for operation at regular intervals, as determined by the risk assessment. For example, a dual channel input MSR connected to an interlocked gate that must be opened every machine cycle (e.g., several times per day) may not have to be checked. This is because opening the guard causes the MSR to check itself, its inputs and its outputs (depending on confi guration) for single faults. The more frequent the guard opening the greater the integrity of the checking process. Another example might be emergency stops. Since emergency stops are typically used only for emergencies, they are likely to be rarely used. Therefore a program should be established to exercise the emergency stops and confi rm their effectiveness on a scheduled basis. Exercising the safety system in this way is called performing a functional test. A third example might be access doors for machine 44 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Implementation of Protective Measures adjustments, which like emergency stops might be rarely used. Here again a program should be established to exercise the checking function on
