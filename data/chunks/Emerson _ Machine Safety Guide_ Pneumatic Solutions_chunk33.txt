• Eight different sizes offered in the series to meet all required distance measurement ranges, from 32 to 256 mm Connection variants: Any mounting position Mounting from above Maximum measurement range Emerson expertise – AVENTICS sensors| Machine safety 45 The SM6-AL analog distance measuring sensor constantly records piston movement over the entire stroke. It enables high-resolution distance measurement and exact positioning in measurement ranges from 107 to 1,007 millimeters. The distance measuring sensor is thus perfectly suited for the continuous recording of piston movements in pneumatic cylinders and is an ideal solution for cylinders with medium and long strokes. The SM6-AL is suitable for all standard cylinders. Its universal design offers various assembly options. The robust, chemical-resistant aluminum housing, as well as a cable sleeve support, guarantee a long sensor service life and reduce maintenance costs. Sensor Series SM6-AL Your advantages: • Zero point and measurement range settings via teach-in button • Choice of any mounting position and cable exit • High accuracy and linearity • Excellent repeatability and reliability through proven Hall sensors • Flexible selection of sizes in the series to meet all required distance measurement ranges, from 107 to 1,007 mm Free definition of a measurement range Minimum measuring range 107 mm Connection variants: Variants up to a maximum measuring range 1,007 mm 46 Machine safety | Emerson expertise – AVENTICS sensors SISTEMA, the software assistant SISTEMA provides assistance in evaluating machine control safety within the scope of ISO 13849-1. The Windows tool simulates the structure of SRP/CS (safety-related parts of a control system) based on so-called “designated architectures” and calculates reliability values at different levels of detail, including the achieved performance level (PL). Risk parameters to determine the required performance level (PL), category, measures to r prevent common cause failures (CCF) for multichannel systems, the mean
