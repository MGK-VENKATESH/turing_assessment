the same as lifetime. (EN) ISO 13849-1 refers to this as Mission Time. A proof test is a check that can detect faults and degradation in a SRCS so that the SRCS can be restored as close as practical to an “as new” condition”. The proof test must detect 100% of all dangerous faults including the diagnostic function (if any). Separate channels must be tested separately. In contrast to diagnostic tests, which are automatic, proof tests are usually performed manually and off line. Being automatic, diagnostic testing is performed often as compared to proof testing which is done infrequently. For example, the circuits going to an interlock switch on a guard can be tested automatically for short and open circuit conditions with diagnostic (e.g., pulse) testing. The proof test interval must be declared by the manufacturer. Sometimes the manufacturer will provide a range of different proof test intervals. It is more usual to just replace the subsystem with a new one rather that actually perform a proof test. Safe Failure Fraction (SFF) The safe failure fraction is similar to diagnostic coverage but also takes account of any inherent tendency to fail towards a safe state. For example, when a fuse blows, there is a failure but it is highly probable that the failure will be to an open circuit which, in most cases, would be a “safe” failure. SFF is (the sum of the rate of “safe” failures plus the rate of detected dangerous failures) divided by (the sum of the rate of “safe” failures plus the rate of detected and undetected dangerous failures). It is important to realize that the only types of failures to be considered are those which could have some effect on the safety function. 96 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 System Design According to IEC/EN 62061 The
