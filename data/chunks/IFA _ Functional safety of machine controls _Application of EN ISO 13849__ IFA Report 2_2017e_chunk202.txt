seconds, n is 1,382,400 cycles per year and the MTTF is op D 145 years. This is also the MTTF value per channel, which is capped to 100 years (“high”). D • DC and measures against common cause failures are not relevant in Category 1. avg • The pneumatic control satisfies Category 1 with a high MTTF (100 years). This results in an average probability of D dangerous failure of 1.1 · 10-6 per hour. This satisfies PL c. Following the addition of further safety-related parts of control systems in the form of subsystems for completion of the safety function, the PL may under certain circum- stances be lower. In consideration of the estimation erring on the safe side as described above, a value of 14 years is produced for the operation time (T ) before the wearing directional control valve 1V1 must be replaced. 10D More detailed reference • VDMA technical rule 24584: Safety functions of regulated and unregulated (fluid) mechanical systems (08.16) Figure 8.6: Determining of the PL by means of SISTEMA 109 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS 8.2.3 Hydraulic valve (subsystem) – Category 1 – PL c (Example 3) hazardous * movement 1A well-tried valve for safety-related applications 1V3 a b 1Z3 1V2 1V1 1Z2 1Z1 M 1S1 1S2 Figure 8.7: 1M 3 1P Hydraulic valve for the control of hazardous movements Safety functions • Safety-related stop function: stopping of the hazardous movement and prevention of unexpected start-up from the rest position • Only the hydraulic part of the control system is shown here, in the form of a subsystem.
