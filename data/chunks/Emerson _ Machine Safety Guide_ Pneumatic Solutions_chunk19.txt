be actuated to extend and retract the cylinder. Design features Basic and well-tried safety principles are met for all relevant components. The directional valves comply with the quiescent current principle and have sufficient positive overlap. The non- return valves must be engineered to assume an open state, even with failure, to safely exhaust the cylinder chambers. The switching valve function of 1V1 and 2V1 is periodically checked by querying the cylinder position switches 1S1 and 1S2 and the pressure switch 2S1.

Block diagram 1V1 The components are arranged • In series when the components work together to execute a function. 2V1 • In parallel “channels” if they perform the function independently (redundant). • There are monitoring elements in addition to the functional 1S1 1S2 2S1 block diagram. • Drive-related hazards are not taken into account.

For the complete safety function, additional safety- related control components (e.g. as guards and electrical logic) must be added as subsystems. In the basic valve position, the pressure in the cylinder is chambered; the cylinder stops when forces are balanced. Stopping/holding the cylinder occurs redundantly via two paths: • If 2V1 is not actuated, the valves 2V2 and 2V3 will remain in the locked position. • If 1V1 is not
