a potentially serious hazard Interlocking means that the opening of the guard is converted into an electrical signal that stops the dangerous movement. Physical guards are normally interlocked using position switches. The interlocking of a physical guard should fulfill the following functions: • The dangerous machine function cannot be initiated with the guard open (missing) (preventing start). • The dangerous machine functions are stopped when the guard is opened (removed) (initiating a stop). The following section describes the essential requirements on interlocking devices associated with physical guards according to ISO 14119. 62 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION There are four types of interlocking device: Table 21: Types of interlocking devices according to ISO 14119 Designation Actuation Actuator SICK product Principle Examples Principle Examples Example i10P Switching cam i10R Type 1 Not coded Turning lever Physical con‐ Mechanical tact, force, pres‐ sure i10H Hinge i16S Shaped actuator (switching rod) Type 2 Coded Key – IME2S Inductive Suitable ferromagnetic materials Magnets, electromagnets MM12 1 Magnetic All suitable materials CM18 1 Type 3 Capacitive Not coded All suitable materials UM12 1 Non-contact Ultrasound All suitable materials WT 12 1 Optical Magnetic Coded magnet RE1/2 Type 4 RFID Coded Coded RFID transponder STR1 Optical Coded optical actuator – 1 These sensors are not designed for safety applications. If they are used in interlocking devices, the designer must give very careful consideration to systematic and common cause failures and take additional measures accordingly. NOTE Type 3 interlocking devices should only be used if the risk assessment shows that manipulation is not foreseeable or additional measures have been applied to prevent it. 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 63 Subject to change without notice 3C –
