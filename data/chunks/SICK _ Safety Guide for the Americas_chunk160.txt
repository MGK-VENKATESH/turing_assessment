From the point of view ISO 13849-1 combines the MTTFd figures into ranges: of ISO 13849-1, only dangerous failures need to be considered Designation Range (hence d). Low 3 years ≤ MTTFd < 10 years This value represents a theoretical parameter expressing the Medium 10 years ≤ MTTFd < 30 years probability of a dangerous failure of a component (not the
