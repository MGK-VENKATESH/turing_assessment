common cause failure 19 4 Report and standard: an overview In the first instance, a machine should be constructed is conducted to ascertain whether the required risk such that it is no longer able to present a hazard in use reduction, the target PL value (block 6 in Figure 4.1), can r (inherent safety). The second step is then that of reducing be attained by means of the planned implementation the risk of any hazard that may still arise. This can be (blocks 4 and 5 in Figure 4.1) with the actual PL value. attained by protective measures, which often comprise The steps of blocks 4 and 5 are described in detail in a combination of protective equipment and safe control. Chapter 6. Following the tradition of the previous control In order for these protective measures to attain a defined system reports, Chapter 8 of this report also contains quality in consideration of the risk, an essential step is a large number of formulated circuit examples for all that of risk assessment, as required by the Machinery control technologies and each Category. In addition, the Directive and described in EN ISO 12100 [3]. Protective general descriptions contained in Chapters 5, 6 and 7 are devices are regarded in the sense of EN ISO 13849-1 accompanied by a comprehensive description of a circuit (safeguards) together with the safe control as the safety- example (paper cutting guillotine). This provides the related part of a control system. Together, they execute a developer with an illustrative explanation of the methods safety function; they may for example prevent unexpected and parameters described below. start-up when an operator enters a hazard zone. Since a machine can easily have several safety functions (for Safety-related parts of control systems are able to exert example for automatic and setup
