first place. • Design so that the operators are exposed to the hazard zone as little as possible. • Avoid dangers produced directly due to electrical power (direct and indirect contact) or produced indirectly due to faults in the control system. Emergency operation, stopping/shutting down 1 • Plan a control for stopping the machine in normal operation. • Use an emergency stop to shut down a dangerous process or a dangerous movement. • Use emergency switching off if power supplies that produce a hazard need to be safely isolated. • Establish a hazardous energy control program (Lock-Out/Tag-Out). EMC • Design machines that meet applicable EMC requirements. The components used shall be selected and verified so that: 2 • They do not cause electromagnetic interferences that affect other devices or systems. • They are themselves immune to the disturbances to be expected. 2-16 GUIDE FOR SAFE MACHINERY | SICK 7028282/2014-09-08 Subject to change without notice Risk reduction Technical protective measures Risk reduction Technical protective measures Step 3: Technical protective measures Technical protective measures, also Functional safety known as engineering controls, are Where the effect of a protective measure implemented with: is dependent on the correct function of • Protective devices that are part of a a control system, the term “functional safety function, e.g., covers, doors, safety” is used.
