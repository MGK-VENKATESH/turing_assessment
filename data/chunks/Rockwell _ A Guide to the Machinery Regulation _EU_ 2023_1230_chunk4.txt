partially self-evolving Annex II behavior using machine learning approaches ensuring safety functions. The other addition in Annex II is filtration systems intended for integration into machinery cabins, in order to protect operators or other persons against hazardous materials and substances, including pesticides. It also covers filters for such filtration systems.

Autonomous mobile machinery (Clause 3.6.3.3) gains extra requirements, which are included in annex III and the supplementary essential health and safety requirements to offset risks due to the mobility of machinery or related products. Protection against corruption (Clause 1.1.9) introduces cyber security requirements related to OT (Operational Technology) and has been added to cover the increase in industrial networks for safety systems, and also the generation of data to support Annex III the growth of connected enterprise solutions. It covers both hardware and software requirements. Machinery needs to ensure that the connection of another device – either locally or remotely – doesn’t lead to a hazardous situation. In addition, any hardware component that transmits signals or data and has access to software that is critical for the machinery’s compliance to relevant health and safety requirements, needs to be protected against both accidental or intentional corruption, and will collect evidence of both legitimate or illegitimate interventions. Finally, for protection against corruption, software and
