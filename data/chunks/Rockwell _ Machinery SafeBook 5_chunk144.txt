feature. Safe Torque-Off is an optional feature for the PowerFlex 40P, 70, 700H, 700S, and 750-Series AC drives, which also support Safe Speed Monitor functionality. • Kinetix® integrated motion Kinetix 300, 6000, 6200, 6500 and 7000 servo drives all feature built-in safety functionality. With Safe Torque-Off, a drive output is disabled to remove motor torque without removing power from the entire machine. Safe Speed Monitoring permits users to reduce and monitor the speed of the application to help an operator safely perform some types of work without completely stopping the machine. Connection systems/networks • ‘Quick connect’ connection systems Guardmaster® Safety t-ports/splitters, distribution boxes, and shorting plugs are parts of a quick-disconnect system that is dedicated to machine safety. • GuardLink™ GuardLink is a safety-based communicatons protocol utilising standard cabling in a ‘trunk and drop’ topology with ‘plug and play’ connections. It enables communication of safety devices for diagnostics and control such as remote reset and lock commands over a single cable. As many as 32 devices can be connected on a cable span of up to 1,000 metres. Allen-Bradley safety devices featuring GuardLink technology give you access to safety system information and enables this information to be accessed over EtherNet/IP. GuardLink can help simplify system confi guration, reduce wiring and increase diagnostic information for maintenance and operation. 140 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Products, tools and services • Safety over EtherNet/IP The EtherNet/IP™ network provides plant-wide network systems using open, industry-standard networking technologies. It offers real-time control and information in discrete, continuous process, batch, safety, drive, motion, and high availability applications. EtherNet/IP networks connect devices such as motor starters and sensors to controllers and HMI devices and on into the wider enterprise. It supports non-industrial and industrial communications on a single, common network infrastructure. Tools to help you A wide range of
