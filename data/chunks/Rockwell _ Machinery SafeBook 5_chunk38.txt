in isolation or in an overly simplistic manner. Evaluation After the protective measure has been chosen and before it is implemented it is important to repeat the risk estimation. This is a procedure that is often missed. It may be that if we install a protective measure, the machine operator may feel that they are totally and completely protected against the original envisaged risk. Because they no longer have the original awareness of danger, they may intervene with the machine in a different way. They may be exposed to the hazard more often, or they may enter further into the machine for example. This means that if the protective measure fails they will be at a greater risk than envisaged before. This is the actual risk that we need to estimate. Therefore the risk estimation needs to be repeated taking into account any foreseeable changes in the way that people may intervene with the machine. The result of this activity is used to check whether the proposed protective measures are, in fact, suitable. For further information Annex A of IEC/EN 62061 is recommended. Training, personal protective equipment etc. It is important that operators have the necessary training in the safe working methods for a machine. This does not mean that the other measures can be omitted. It is not acceptable to merely tell an operator that they must not go near dangerous areas (as an alternative to guarding them). It may also be necessary for the operator to use equipment such as special gloves, goggles, respirators, etc. The machinery designer should specify what sort of equipment is required. The use of personal protective equipment will not usually form the primary safeguarding method but will complement the measures shown above. There will also usually be a need for signs and marking
