the components diagram from which the functional and test channels can be seen. Components Safety-related hardware units, parts of the control system Subsystem (SB) Largest unit of components which executes the safety function fully or in sections. A subsystem possesses a continuous struc- ture and is described by a Category. Encapsulated subsys- Safety component for which the manufacturer already states the tem PL, PFH and Category. The internal structure need not therefore be considered more closely. Functional channel Hardware units connected in series; chains of components which execute the entire safety function from the sensor to the actuator. Redundant subsystems possess (at least) two independent func- tional channels. Function signal Signal that passes the demand for the safety function on along a functional channel from the sensor to the actuator, where for example it leads to disconnection. Redundant function Hardware unit connected in parallel; component in a section of a block redundant functional channel; part of a functional channel in Category 3 or 4 subsystems. Non-redundant functi- Component in a section of a non-redundant functional channel; on block part of a functional channel in Category B, 1 or 2 subsystems. Test channel Chain of components which transmits a "Testing" disconnection signal (not to be confused with the signal path over which test signals are exchanged between the testing and tested blocks for the detection of a dangerous failure). Testing disconnection Transmits the result of a test which has detected a dangerous signal failure of a function block, from a test block to a function block further on or to an additional disconnecting block, with the result that the safety function is successfully completed or a safe state is brought about. Test block Hardware unit for diagnostics: Component that tests one or more function blocks and generates a "Testing" disconnection signal
