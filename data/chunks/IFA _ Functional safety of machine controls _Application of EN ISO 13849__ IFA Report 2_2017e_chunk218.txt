Functional description • The hazardous movement is stopped if either the stop button S1 or one of the emergency stop devices S3 or S4 is actuated. Only actuation by means of the emergency-stop device S3 is considered in this example. The drive is halted in an emergency in response to actuation of S3: first by deactivation of the emergency stop safety module K4, accompanied by shut-off of the contactor relays K1 and K2. Opening of the make contact K1 on the input I4 of the PLC K5 causes the starting signal on the frequency inverter (FI) T1 to be cancelled via the PLC output O2. Redun- dantly to the K1-K5-T1 chain, opening of the make contact K2 upstream of the contactor relay with drop-out delay K3 128 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS S3.1 K1 K5 T1 K4 S3.2 K2 K3 C1 Q1 initiates a braking timer; upon timeout of the braking timer, the actuating signal for the mains contactor Q1 is inter- rupted. The timer setting is selected such that under unfavourable operating conditions, the machine movement is halted before the mains contactor Q1 has dropped out. • Functional stopping of the drive following a stop command is initiated by opening of the two break contacts of the stop button S1. As with stopping in an emergency, the
