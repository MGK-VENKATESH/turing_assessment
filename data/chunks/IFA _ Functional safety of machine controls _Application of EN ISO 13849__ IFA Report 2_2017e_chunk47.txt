example, the machine must be set up whilst running at limited speed, the parameter P1 will be the correct choice • S1 – slight (normally reversible injury) at the low acceleration values for setup: with the slow emergence of the hazards and given sufficient freedom • S2 – serious (normally irreversible injury or death) of movement, the operator will be able to move out of the hazard zone. Conversely, P2 must be selected when The usual consequences of accidents and the normal higher speeds may rapidly be reached and the operator healing processes must be taken into account for deter- has no realistic chance of evading an accident.

For example, rollers moving in the direction of the operator‘s hand cannot entrap it under The frequency of and/or exposure to the hazard are eva- fault-free conditions. In the event of a control-system luated as: fault, however, the direction of rotation could be rever- sed, and under worst-case conditions, the hand would be • F1 – seldom to less often, and/or exposure time is short drawn in. • F2 – frequent to continuous, and/or exposure time is A further factor influencing determining of the PL is the r long probability of the occurrence of a hazardous event ([3], 5.5.2.3.2).
