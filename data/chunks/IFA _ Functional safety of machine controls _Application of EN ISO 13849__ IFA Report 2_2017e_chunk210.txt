year, then at a resulting n of 742 cycles per year, Q1 has an MTTF of 35,040 years. This is also the op D MTTF for the channel, which is capped to 100 years (“high”). D • DC and measures against common cause failures are not relevant in Category 1. avg • The electromechanical control system satisfies Category 1 with a high MTTF (100 years). This results in an average D probability of dangerous failure of 1.1 · 10-6 per hour. This satisfies PL c.

Functional description • Hazardous movements or states are interrupted upon actuation of the emergency stop device S1 by undervoltage release of the supply disconnecting device, in this case in the form of a motor starter Q1. • The safety function cannot be maintained with all component failures, and is dependent upon the reliability of the components. • No measures for fault detection are implemented. Design features • Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. Protective circuits (such as
