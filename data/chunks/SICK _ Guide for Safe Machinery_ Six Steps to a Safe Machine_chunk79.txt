change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION Mobile hazardous area protection: detection of a per‐ son approaching the hazardous area Mobile hazardous area protection is used to detect when a person approaches or is present in the hazard‐ ous area of a moving hazardous point. This requires the detection of the lower limbs. The application may require that people lying down are detected. Mobile hazardous area protection is particularly suita‐ ble for autonomous vehicles (e.g., cranes and forklifts). Figure 57: Mobile hazardous area protection of an autono‐ mous forklift truck using a safety laser scanner Automatic material passage using ESPE The following safety functions can be integrated either in the logic unit or directly in suitable ESPE. Automatic protective field switching When large openings of machines are secured using ESPE, changing the shape of the active protective field can allow the passage of materials or packages with different contours. This prevents persons accessing the hazardous zone above or behind these materials. Some types of ESPE (AOPD) allow preprogrammed protective fields to be activated by external signals. Instead of muting the entire protective device ("Muting", page 79), a suitable (vertical) protective field of the ESPE can be activated during passage. In addition, field switching may also be required if the hazardous zones of machines change dynamically dur‐ ing machine operation, e.g., adapted exclusion zones for industrial robots with different operating cycles or for transfer trolleys when docking at a station.
