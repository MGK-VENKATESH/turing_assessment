B Category B should be regarded as the basic foundation upon which all the other Categories are built. It does not have any special provisions or structure for safety beyond the Basic Safety Principles as given in the Annexes A to D of (EN) ISO 13849-2. These represent general good practice in design and selection of materials. Category 1 Category 1 requires the use of Well Tried Components and Well Tried Safety Principles. Shown here is a typical system intended to achieve Category 1. The interlock and the contactor play the key roles in removing energy from the motor, when access to the hazard is needed. The tongue interlock meets the requirements of IEC 60947-5-1 for direct opening action contacts, which is shown by the symbol of the arrow within the circle. With the well-tried components, the probability of energy being removed is higher for Category 1 than it would be for Category B. The use of well-tried components is intended to minimize the possibility of a loss of the safety function but note that a single fault can still lead to the loss of the safety function. 98 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety-Related Control Systems, Additional Considerations +V L1 L2 L3 SCP K1 Start SCP Aux Stop K1 OP Tongue Switch Guard Closed Motor (Hazard) TS K1 Contactor Gnd Simple Category 1 Safety System Category 1 is intended to prevent failure by using simple design with components with high reliability. When this type of prevention by itself does not provide enough reduction of the risk, fault detection must be used. Categories 2, 3 and 4 are failure or fault detection based, with increasingly stringent requirements to achieve higher levels of risk reduction. Category 2 In addition to meeting the requirements of Category B and using well tried safety principles, the
