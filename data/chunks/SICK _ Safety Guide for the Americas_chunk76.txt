The term “frequent opening” is used, e.g., if the guard is hinges, guides, etc. Positive-fit mountings are preferred.

Guards will only be accepted by employees if they do not hinder setup, maintenance, and other similar c activities any more than necessary. Movable guards must meet the following ergonomic criteria: • Easy (e.g., one-handed) opening and closing,
