a control panel designed in accordance with relevant standards. SIL and IEC/EN 62061 IEC/EN 62061 describes both the amount of risk to be reduced and the ability of a control system to reduce that risk in terms of SIL (Safety Integrity Level). There are three SILs used in the machinery sector, SIL 1 is the lowest and SIL 3 is the highest. Because the term SIL is applied in the same manner in other industrial sectors such as petro-chemicals, power generation and railways, IEC/EN 62061 is very useful when machinery is used within those sectors. Risks of greater magnitude can occur in other sectors such as the process industry and for that reason IEC 61508 and the process sector specifi c standard IEC 61511 include SIL 4. 64 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety Related Control Systems & Functional Safety A SIL applies to a safety function. The subsystems that make up the system that implements the safety function must have an appropriate SIL capability. This is sometimes referred to as the SIL Claim Limit (SIL CL). A full and detailed study of IEC/EN 62061 is required before it can be correctly applied. PL and (EN) ISO 13849-1 (EN) ISO 13849-1 does not use the term SIL; instead it uses the term PL (Performance Level). In many respects PL can be related to SIL. There are fi ve performance levels, PLa is the lowest and PLe is the highest. Comparison of PL and SIL This table shows the approximate relationship between PL and SIL when applied to typical circuit structures. PL PFH SIL D (Performance Level) (Probability of dangerous (Safety Integrity Level) failure per hour) a ≥10-5 to <10-4 None b ≥3 x 10-6 to <10-5 1 c ≥10-6 to <3 x 10-6 1 d ≥10-7 to <10-6 2 e ≥10-8 to
