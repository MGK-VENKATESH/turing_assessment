Therefore, the safety function achieves SIL3. • Cutting off the power supply to induce a safe status • Measures to manage the effects of faults and other effects Systematic safety integrity arising out of a shared data communication process, includ- ing transmission faults, repeats, loss, insertion, incorrect When different subsystems are interconnected to create a con- sequence, corruption, delay, etc. (see “Reliable data trans- trol system, additional measures must be taken for systematic mission” g3-68). safety integrity. 7028282/2014-09-08 GUIDE FOR SAFE MACHINERY | SICK 3-89 Subject to change without notice Technical protective measures Risk reduction Determining the level of safety for a subsystem as per IEC 62061 IEC 62061 also supports the determination of the safety level of subsystems created by interconnecting individual compo- nents. 1 1 3 3 d d 3-90 GUIDE FOR SAFE MACHINERY | SICK 7028282/2014-09-08 Subject to change without notice erutcurtS ytilibaileR sisongaiD ecnatsiseR ssecorP Probability of random dangerous hardware failures (PFHd) Alongside structural restrictions, the "probability of dangerous hardware failures" must also be taken into account for each subsystem. Based on a mathematical model, there is a formula to determine the PFHd value for each type of subsystem, SIL whereby the following parameters feature in the calculation: Safety integrity level • Diagnostic coverage HFT PFHd DC/SFF CCF Testing • Mission time • Diagnostic test interval • Failure rate of components (λ ) D • Common cause failure (common cause factor β) HFT = 1 Diagnostics with DC and DC 1 2 λ ×λ ×(DC +DC )×T D1 D2 1 2 D PFHd = (1 –β)² × 2 λ ×λ ×(2 – DC – DC )×T D1 D2 1 2 P + 2 λ +λ The safety integrity level achieved for a subsystem is made up +β× D1 D2 2 of the following parameters:
