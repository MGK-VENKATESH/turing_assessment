block in the Safety Monitoring column and release it. 115 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery Connected Components Workbench software automatically assigns the fi rst two available inputs, EI_00 and EI_01, to the device. Leave those as assigned. Connected Components Workbench software automatically assigns the function name SMF 1 to this block. By default, the software assumes an electro-mechanical device and assigns Test Sources. The SensaGuard switch has two OSSD outputs and does not require Test Sources. 2. To properly confi gure the block, open Advanced Settings and select 2 OSSD from the Inputs pull-down menu. The resulting block appears as shown. 3. Click, drag and release a Feedback Monitoring Safety Monitoring function to the Safety Monitoring block below the SensaGuard block in the workspace. 116 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Application Examples Note that Connected Components Workbench software assigns this to input terminal EI_02, the next available Safety Input terminal. The software assumes that this is a single input and automatically assigns the function name SMF 2 to this block. 4. Because the circuit requires two inputs, one from each contactor, change the number of inputs to 2, one for the N.C. contact from each 100S contactor. 5. Assign the inputs to Plug-In terminals PI_00 and PI_01. This avoids unnecessarily using Safety Inputs for feedback signals. 117 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery 6. Click, drag and release a Reset safety monitoring function to the Safety Monitoring block below the Feedback Monitoring block in the workspace. Connected Components Workbench software automatically assigns the function name SMF 3 to this block. Re-assign the Reset Input to Plug-In terminal PI_02. Confi gure the Outputs Follow these steps to confi gure the outputs. 1. Click and drag Immediate OFF from the Safety Output Function Blocks section of the
