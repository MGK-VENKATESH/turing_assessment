detection zone below 900 mm is not included since they do not offer sufficient protection against circumventing or stepping over • Lower edge of the detection zone above 300 mm in relation to the reference plane does not offer sufficient protection against crawling below When vertical electro-sensitive protective equipment are combined with protective structures (guards) that allow people to lean on the structure, calculate the required height for guards (g 3-61) 7028282/2014-09-08 GUIDE FOR SAFE MACHINERY | SICK 3-57 Subject to change without notice Safeguarding (technical protective measures) Risk reduction How to determine the necessary height for the top edge of the protective field: 1. Determine the height of the hazardous point a and find the In the row defined by a, find the last column in which the § equivalent or next highest value in the left-hand column. shortest additional horizontal distance C is less than or 2. Calculate the supplement C determined by the resolution equal to the calculated supplement C determined by the RT RT using the familiar formulas for perpendicular approach: resolution.
