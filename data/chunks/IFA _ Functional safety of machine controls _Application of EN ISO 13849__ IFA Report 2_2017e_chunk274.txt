and T1 are employed in accordance with the information in subclause 6.3.10. • For the safety functions under analysis, a fault exclusion is assumed for the fault condition of encoder shaft breakage (G1/G2). For details of the possibility of a fault exclusion, refer for example to IEC 61800-5-2, Table D.8/ GS-IFA-M21. Remarks • The circuit example can be employed for implementation of the “safety-related stop function” and “safely limited speed” safety functions in a control system for three-wing and four-wing revolving doors with break-out function (the door wings can be folded manually in an emergency) for use in public and commercial buildings. • Regular manual inspection of the pressure-sensitive edge is required. Firstly, its serviceability must be checked; secondly, the pressure-sensitive edge must be inspected visually in order for any damage to be detected in good time. Calculation of the probability of failure Detailed calculation of the probability of failure is performed for the safety function “safety-related stop function (SS1-r)”, which is also shown in the block diagram: • Since the pressure-sensitive edge with the associated control unit is available commercially as a safety compo- nent, its probability of failure is added at the end of the calculation (3.0 · 10-7 per hour [E]). • The frequency inverter T1 with STO is also available for purchase as a safety component; its probability of failure is added at the end of the calculation (1.5 · 10-8 per hour [M]). The fast stop function T1s is modelled in the first chan- nel of the block diagram. • MTTF : the safety-related components of K1 and K2 and their peripherals are considered, following application of D the parts count method, by a value of 878 years [E]. A value of 190 years [M] is substituted in the formula for G1 and G2. A
