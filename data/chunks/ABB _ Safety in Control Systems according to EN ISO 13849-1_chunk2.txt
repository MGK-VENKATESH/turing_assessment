the system from systematic errors built into the Choice of technology design • PL (Performance Level) is a technology-neutral concept • follow certain rules to ensure software can be developed that can be used for electrical, mechanical, pneumatic and and validated in the right way hydraulic safety solutions. • SIL (Safety Integrity Level) can, however, only be used for The five PL-levels (a-e) correspond to certain ranges of PFH - D electrical, electronic or programmable safety solutions. values (probability of dangerous failure per hour). These indicate how likely it is that a dangerous failure could occur Experience over a period of one hour. In the calculation, it is beneficial EN ISO 13849-1 uses categories from EN 954-1 for defining to use PFH -values directly as the PL is a simplification that the system structure, and therefore the step to the new D does not provide equally accurate results. calculations is not so great if you have previous experience of the categories. EN 62061 defines the structures slightly What is the easiest way of complying differently. with the standard? Customer requirements If the customer comes from an industry that is accustomed 1.
