assess – eliminate The risk assessment process provides the basis for machine safety (see figure on pages 6, 7). The machine manufacturer starts with a risk analysis, minimizes identified risks, and finally determines whether an adequate level of safety is present. If the answer is negative, risk reduction measures must be implemented and quantified in terms of effectiveness. Let’s take a look at some basic terms defined in ISO 12100, which provides a general description of the risk assessment process: Hazards: Potential sources of harm Hazardous situation: Situation in which a person is exposed to at least one hazard. The resulting harm can be immediate or occur over time. Risk: Results from a hazard and is assessed by combining the likelihood of the occurrence of harm and the severity of consequence. c Dangerous c Hot surface electrical voltage c Keep hands clear c Entanglement rotating parts c Risk of entrapment c Cutting hazard c Head injury hazard Basic conditions| Machine safety 5 Towards safe machinery: Risk assessment Globally, and almost without exception, statutory guidelines for the design and operation of machines mandate a risk assessment to identify potential hazards, minimize risks, and comply with applicable health and safety requirements. The process helps determine the type and quality of preventive measures or safeguards.
