warn the operator before automatic protective measures are initiated. The following should be noted: • Warning devices must be designed and arranged so that they can easily be checked and inspected. • The information for use shall include the prescrip‐ tion of the regular inspection of warning equip‐ ment. • Sensorial saturation should be avoided, in particu‐ lar where audible alarms are concerned. Examples: • Interlocking indications • Startup warning devices • Muting lamps Figure 32: Safety-related indications on an autonomous fork‐ lift truck Other functions Safety devices can also perform other functions. The actual safety functions must not be impaired as a result of this. Examples: • Tool and machine protection • PSDI mode (cycle initiation - see "Additional functions of ESPE", page 81 ff) • Using the measurement data of a safety laser scanner to navigate an autonomous vehicle Summary: Defining the safety functions Define which safety functions are required for risk reduction: • Permanently preventing entry/access • Temporarily preventing access • Retaining parts/substances/radiation • Initiating a stop • Avoiding an unexpected start-up • Preventing start • Combination of initiating a stop/preventing start • Allowing material passage • Monitoring machine parameters • Safeguarding work areas shared by humans and machines • Disabling safety functions manually and for a limited time • Combining or switching safety functions • Emergency stop • Safety-related indications and alarms 50 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 3B – DETERMINING THE REQUIRED SAFETY LEVEL 3b – Determining the required safety level As a rule, type-C standards (machine-specific standards) shall specify the required safety level. The required safety level must be defined separately for each safety function, and applies for all devices involved, for example … • the sensor/the protective device • the evaluating logic unit
