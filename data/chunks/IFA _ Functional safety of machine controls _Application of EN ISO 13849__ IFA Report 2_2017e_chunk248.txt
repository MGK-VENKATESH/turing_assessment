diversity in Q1/T1 (20) • The subsystems B1/B2 and B3.1/B3.2 correspond to Category 4 with a high MTTF and high DC (99%). This results D avg in an average probability of dangerous failure of 3.3 · 10-8 per hour and 2.5 · 10-8 per hour. The subsystem Q1/ T1 satisfies Category 3 with a high MTTF (68.9 years) and low DC (62%). This results in an average probability D avg of dangerous failure of 1.8 · 10-7 per hour for the safety function of “position monitoring of interlocking devices (guard 1, loading)”. 158 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS • For the safety function of “position monitoring of interlocking devices (guard 2, unloading)”, the average probabi- lity of dangerous failure is 2.1 · 10-7 per hour. This corresponds in both cases to PL d. • The average probability of dangerous failure for the emergency stop function is 2.0 · 10-7 per hour. This satisfies PL d.

Functional description • Opening of the movable guard (e.g. safety guard) is detected by two position switches B1 and B2 employing a break contact/make contact combination. The position switch B1 with direct opening contact actuates a contactor Q2, which interrupts/prevents hazardous movements or states
