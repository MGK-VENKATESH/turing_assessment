loaded into the cell manually through As protection, an interlocked door is selected with the key the rear door. A batch is prepared for the packing conveyor switch JSNY8. Downtime is short enough for the dangerous in the infeed hopper. The cell is reset and restarted. The movement to have stopped before the operator can access packaging machine with conveyor belt only operates hen it. The emergency stop is placed within easy reach, on both both doors are closed and when the protection system has sides of the cell near the locked doors. been reset. In the risk assessment it was established that the machine PLr is to be operated in three shifts (8 hours per shift) 365 days (cid:51)(cid:20) a low risk a year. It is assumed that operational disturbances were (cid:41)(cid:20) (cid:51)(cid:21) resolved in less than one minute in the danger zone. This can (cid:54)(cid:20) (cid:41)(cid:21) (cid:51)(cid:20) b be carried out two times per hour (F2). Unexpected start- (cid:51)(cid:21) ups are not deemed to cause serious injury but rather minor c high risk (cid:51)(cid:20) healable injuries (S1). The operator is deemed not to have the (cid:54)(cid:21) (cid:41)(cid:20) (cid:51)(cid:21) d possibility of avoiding injury as the machine moves quickly (cid:41)(cid:21) (cid:51)(cid:20) (P2). (cid:51)(cid:21) e The number of cycles for the safety function = 365 days/ year · (3·8) hours/day · 2 cycles/hour = 17,520 cycles/year Assessment of the PL necessary for the safety function with r interlocked door for this example. The assessment for the safety function required for access to the machine is PL= c (S1, F2, P2).
