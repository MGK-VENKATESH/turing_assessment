This is because EN ISO 13849-1 is based on a “mission Mean Time To dangerous Failure (MTTF d ) time” of 20 years. The MTTF -value should primarily come from the d Common Cause Failure (CCF) manufacturer. If the manufacturer cannot provide values, In Appendix F of EN ISO 13849-1 there is a table of actions they are given from tables in EN ISO 13849-1 or you have to be taken to protect against CCF, to ensure a failure does to calculate MTTF using the B -value, (average number d 10d not knock out both channels. of cycles until 10 % of the components have a dangerous Systematic errors Appendix G of EN ISO 13849-1 describes a range of actions Calculation of the average number of cycles is as that need to be taken to protect against incorporating faults follows: into your design.
