BIA Report 6/2004 ISBN 3-88383-672-9 Safety-related pneumatics Electropneumatic control systems use a logic unit to implement safety functions. The logic unit provides electrical signals that act on the drive/actuators via a combination of a number of valves; these valves act as power control elements. Typical safety-related functions can be allocated to a machine’s operating modes as safety sub-functions. Purely pneumatic control systems exist alongside electropneumatic control systems. The advantage of these solutions is that the deterministic nature of the pneumatics makes it relatively easy to set up safety sub-functions that are purely pneumatic. 124 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION Aerate Hold pressure Pressure and Vent force reduction Initial setting, standstill Setup and Normal operation service mode Two-hand Protection against operation tampering, protection against Emergency operation unexpected starting Reduction in Switch to Stop, hold, block Reverse the speed zero force the movement movement Direct pneumatic effect on movement Indirect pneumatic effect on movement Source: Festo SE & Co.
