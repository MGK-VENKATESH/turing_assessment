The signals are read into a standard safety module K2, which is looped into the enabling path for the electrical pilot control K1 (a conventional PLC) for the hydraulic actuators. Hazardous movements or states are controlled on the actuator side by three directional control valves (1V3, 1V4 and 1V5). In response to a demand of the safety function, all valves are de-energized elec- trically by K2, and are placed by their return springs in the closed centre position (1V4) or closed position (1V3 and 1V5). The oil return from the end of the cylinder above the piston to the reservoir is interrupted simultaneously by the valves 1V4 and 1V5. 1V5 is a poppet valve that is designed to shut off
