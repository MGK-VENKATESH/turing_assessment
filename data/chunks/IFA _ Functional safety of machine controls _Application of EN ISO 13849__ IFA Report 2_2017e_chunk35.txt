a strategy for risk includes consideration for the defeating of safeguards. reduction – includes the design of safety-related parts of control systems1. 1 Safety-related parts of control systems are one means by which a safety function is implemented. The starting-point for these systems is the reception of safety-related input signals, for example detection of the position of a guard door by means of a Type 2 position switch, the separate actuator of which is fitted to the door and itself constitutes a safety-related part. Once received, the signals are processed, leading to generation of an output signal. 25 5 Safety functions and their contribution to risk reduction Figure 5.1: Iterative risk reduction process START Risk assessment carried out Determination of the limits in accordance with ISO 12100 of the machinery (see section 5.3a) yes Hazard identification (see section 5.4a a nd Annex Ba) This iterative risk reduction process shall be carried out Risk estimation separately for each hazard (see section 5.5a) under each condition of use (task). Risk evaluation (see section 5.6a) Are no other hazards generated? Has the risk been yes END adequately reduced? no Risk reduction process for the hazard: 1 by inherently safe design 2 by safeguards 3 by information for use (see Figure 1a) Iterative process of the design of safety-related parts of control systems (SRP/CSs) (see Figure 3b) Does the protective measure yes selected depend on a control system? no a Refers to ISO 12100:2010 b Refers to ISO 13849-1 26 5 Safety functions and their contribution to risk reduction The hazards are then identified; all phases of the The objective of the further procedure is to reduce the risk machine‘s lifetime must be considered in this process.
