are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. Protective circuits (such as contact protection) as described in the initial paragraphs of Chapter 8 are implemented. • The contactor relays K1, K2 and K3 possess mechanically linked contacts in accordance with IEC 60947-5-1, Annex L. • The pushbuttons S1, S3 and S4 possess direct opening contacts in accordance with IEC 60947-5-1, Annex K. • The contactor Q1 possesses a mirror contact in accordance with IEC 60947-4-1, Annex F. • The standard components K5 and T1 are employed in accordance with the guidance in subclause 6.3.10. • The software (SRASW) is programmed in accordance with the requirements for PL b (downgraded owing to diversity) and the guidance in subclause 6.3.10. • Delayed attainment of standstill by the second shut-off path alone in the event of a fault must not involve an un acceptably high residual risk. • The SRP/CS of the emergency stop safety module K4 satisfies all requirements for Category 3 and PL d. Calculation of the probability of failure Only the probability of failure of the emergency stop function is calculated. • The emergency-stop device S3 is equipped with two break contacts S3.1 and S3.2. The manufacturer states a B of 10D 127,500 cycles for each of the blocks S3.1 and S3.2. With actuation annually and a resulting n of 1 cycle per year, op the MTTF of each contact is 1,275,000 years. The emergency stop safety module K4 is a tested safety component. D Its probability of failure is 3.0 · 10-7 per hour [M], and is added at the end of the calculation. 129 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS The following applies for the probability of failure of the downstream two-channel structure: • MTTF : the PLC K5 has an MTTF of ten years [S].
