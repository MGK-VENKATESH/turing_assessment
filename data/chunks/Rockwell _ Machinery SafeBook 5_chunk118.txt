was no specifi c defi nitive guidance on this but it was usual to assume a DC of 60% under the condition that the switches are individually tested at suitable periods to reveal faults. If it was foreseeable that one (or more) of the switches would never be individually tested then it could be argued that its DC should be described as zero. ISO TR 24119 provides detailed guidance for the determination of DC for guard interlocking devices using series connected volt-free contacts. The following Table provides a basic overview. It is essential to study the document in full in order to determine the actual maximum allowable DC for any particular architecture and application.

Note that in any case, if it is foreseeable that fault masking will occur (e.g. multiple movable guards will be open at the same time as part of normal operation or service), then the DC is limited to none. It is interesting to note that these characteristics of a Category 3 structure have always required consideration but they are brought into sharp focus by the functional safety standards. Category 4 Like Category 3, Category 4 requires the safety system to meet
