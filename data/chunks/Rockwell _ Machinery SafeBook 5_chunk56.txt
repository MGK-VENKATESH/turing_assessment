the circuit as well as breaking the circuit. Example 1: An A150, AC-15 rating indicates that the contacts can make a 7200VA circuit. At 120V AC, the contacts can make a 60 amp inrush circuit. Since the AC- 15 is an electromagnetic load, the 60 amp is only for a short duration; the inrush current of the electromagnetic load. The breaking of the circuit is only 720 VA because the steady state current of the electromagnetic load is 6A, which is the rated operational current. Example 2: An N150, DC-13 rating indicates that the contacts can make a 275VA circuit. At 125V AC, the contacts can make a 2.2 amp circuit. DC electromagnetic 46 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Implementation of Protective Measures loads do not have an inrush current like AC electromagnetic loads. The breaking of the circuit is also 275VA because the steady state current of the electromagnetic load is 2.2 amp, which is the rated operational current. Machine Re-start If, for example, an interlocked guard is opened on an operating machine, the safety interlock switch will stop that machine. In most circumstances it is imperative that the machine does not restart immediately when the guard is closed. A common way of achieving this is to rely on a latching contactor start arrangement. Pressing and releasing the start button momentarily energizes the contactor control coil which closes the power contacts. As long as power is fl owing through the power contacts the control coil is kept energized (electrically latched) via the contactorâ€™s auxiliary contacts which are mechanically linked to the power contacts. Any interruption to the main power or control supply results in the de-energizing of the coil and opening of the main power and auxiliary contacts. The guard interlock is wired into the contactor control circuit. This means that
