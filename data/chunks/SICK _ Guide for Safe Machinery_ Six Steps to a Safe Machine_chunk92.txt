the energy from all energy sources which pose a hazard shall be dissipated. This procedure is known as emergency stopping. Every machine must be equipped with at least one emergency stop function, except: • Machines for which an emergency stop would not reduce the risk • Hand-held and hand-guided machines The emergency stop function must be triggered by a single action of a person. The following fundamental requirements apply to the emergency stop function and its devices in accordance with ISO 13850: • The actuators of emergency stop control switches must be easily accessible. • The emergency stop function must end the dangerous state in a suitable manner as quickly as possible without creating additional risks. • The emergency stop function must take priority over all other functions and commands in all operating modes. • The emergency stop function must not impair the effectiveness of other safety functions. • Resetting the emergency stop control switches must not initiate a restart. • The principle of direct mechanical positive actuation with mechanical interlocking function must be applied (referred to as a latching function in IEC 60947-5-1). • When an emergency stop control switch is actuated, a stop command must be triggered, regardless of the effectiveness of the mechanical interlock function or latching function. • The emergency stop function must conform to stop category 0 or 1 (see "Stopping", page 35). • The emergency stop function must be designed in such a way that decisions to trigger it do not require the relevant person to think about the consequences (e.g., economic losses). 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 89 Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION Reset If an emergency stop device is actuated, devices triggered by this action must remain in the off state
