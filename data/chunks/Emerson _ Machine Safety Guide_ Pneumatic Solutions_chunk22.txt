independent pneumatic supply, e.g. for maintenance purposes. pressure zones for customized pressure supply to different circuits and ensures adequate, rapid system exhaust. 10 Pressure sensor module: processes four pneumatic inputs Optional: Module for monitoring the switch-off voltage (pressure or vacuum) from a pneumatic control and converts threshold of the valves. When falling below the voltage the pneumatic pressure into digital information of the Zone 3 Zone 2 Zone 1 Supplied from threshold, which disables the valve, the module provides serial transmission system. The module provides diagnostic Port 4 Sandwich P P P a diagnostic message via the fieldbus. This allows you to capabilities via LED and supply voltage monitoring. All to Zoned Pilot identify why the valves were switched off. necessary functions are integrated.

It can be with position detection prevents compressed air from entering integrated at the right end of D-Sub or fieldbus valve the operating line â€“ even in the event of accidental actuation of systems. The two following valve positions are controlled the upstream 5/3 WV CC 1V1. In home position, the valve shuts via the M12 connection. off all channels. In conjunction with an upstream 5/3 WV CC in safety-relevant control chains, for example, you can achieve two 6 Throttle module: With the two-channel pressure module, channels to safeguard against accident restart or for safe stops. the flow in both operating lines can be limited, reducing the cylinder
