and the restart interlock (RES) is engaged on interruption of at least one light beam. This interlock ensures that the machine can only be restarted if the light path is clear and the reset button has been pressed and released again. S Safety function Function of a machine whose failure can result in an immediate increase of the - 3-2 risk(s) (ISO 12100). A safety function is provided by safety-related parts of control systems (g SRP/CS). Sensor detection capability/Resolution The limit for the sensor parameter that causes the electro-sensitive protective - 3-30 equipment (g ESPE) to respond.
