Safety-related stop function: stopping of a hazardous movement and prevention of unexpected start-up from the rest position • Only the hydraulic part of the control system is shown here, in the form of a subsystem. Further safety-related control components (e.g. safeguards and electrical logic elements) must be added in the form of subsystems for completion of the safety function. Functional description • Hazardous movements are controlled by the directional control valve 1V3. • Failure of the directional control valve 1V3 between functional tests may result in loss of the safety function. The probability of failure is dependent upon the reliability of the directional control valve. • Testing of the safety function is forced via the PLC K1 by means of a displacement measurement system 1S3. Testing takes place at suitable intervals and in response to a demand of the safety function. Detection of a failure of 1V3 leads to the hydraulic pump 1M/1P being switched off by the contactor Q1. 136 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS 1V3 1S3 K1 Q1 • Interruption of the hazardous movement by the hydraulic pump generally results in a longer overrun. The distance from the hazard zone must be selected in consideration of the longer overrun. • The test function must not be impaired by failure of the directional control valve. Failure of the test function must not lead to failure of the directional control valve. Design features • Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. • 1V3 is a directional control valve with closed centre position, sufficient overlap and spring-centred central position. • The safety-oriented switching position is attained by cancellation of the control signal. • Testing may for example take the form of checking of the distance/time characteristic (displacement measurement system 1S3) of the hazardous
