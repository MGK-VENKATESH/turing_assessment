SFF= 75 % S HFT 0 means that a single failure in the hardware can result in λ DU the loss of the safety function (single-channel systems). HFT 1 means that despite a single failure in the hardware, protection is maintained (dual-channel systems). The "safe failure fraction" (SFF) consists of the diagnostic cover- Subsystem Element 1: age DC (λ /λ ) and the "safe failure" fraction (λ ).
