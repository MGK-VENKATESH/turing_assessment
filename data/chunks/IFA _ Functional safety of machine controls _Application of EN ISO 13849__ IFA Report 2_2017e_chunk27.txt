Further explanations of this subject can be found certain circumstances give rise to several faults which in Annex B. may for example simultaneously disable both control channels. For control of this source of hazard, it must One of the questions most frequently asked regarding be demonstrated for Category 2, 3 and 4 systems that the probability of failure concerns the sourcing of reliable adequate measures have been taken against CCF. This is failure data for the safety-related components, the MTTF achieved by means of a points system for eight typical, D (mean time to dangerous failure) values.
