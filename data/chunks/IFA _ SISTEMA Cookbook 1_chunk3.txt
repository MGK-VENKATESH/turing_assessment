the safety function in a functional channel (redundant structures possess two functional channels). They also include all test facilities responsible for detecting such dangerous failures and bringing about a safe state. A sche- matic circuit diagram shows for example the electrical circuitry of position switches, pro- grammable logic controllers (PLCs) and contactors, and the flow of current from the sensor, via signal processing, to the actuator. Example 1 (Figure 2) shows an implementation of the safety function for "opening of the movable guard initiates the safe torque off (STO) safety function". All other components which are purely functional and have no influence upon the safety function have already been omitted. Figure 2: Schematic circuit diagram showing relevant components (Example 1); see BGIA Report 2/2008e, Chapter 8.2.18 SISTEMA Cookbook (Version 1.0) - 6 - 2 Schematic circuit diagram showing functional and test channels 2.2 Entering the function and test channels The functional channels are first marked on the schematic circuit diagram. It has been found effective in practice to "work backwards", i.e. to begin at the actuator end and follow the channel back to the sensor. This yields the signal paths from the triggering event to the response of the safety function (Figure 3). Figure 3: Schematic circuit diagram with two redundant functional channels, B1-Q2 and B2-K1-Q1 (Example 1) Where circuits employ a test channel with a dedicated disconnecting device (Category 2), this test channel is also marked on the schematic circuit diagram. Figure 4 shows the exam- ple of a protective device fitted at the intake of a roller; when the device is tripped, the motor is stopped within 1/3 of a rotation. In this example, the angle of rotation required for the motor to come to a stop is tested regularly by manual actuation of the protective device. SISTEMA
