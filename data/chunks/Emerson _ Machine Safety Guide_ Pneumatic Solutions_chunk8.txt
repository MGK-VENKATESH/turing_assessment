Application example 2 Determine the trigger event. Safe stop function – halts dangerous movement and prevents unintended activation from the resting state 3 Define the safe state. Actuator stops after crossing light grille. 4 Specify the required reaction. Actuator is disabled. 5 Name the safety function. “Controlled stopping of the movement and e Risk analysis for application of the holding brake in the rest a forming component position” (see also IFA Report 2/2017).

It is also the framework for all other quantifiable aspects that ultimately go into calculating the performance level of safety-related elements of the control system. In industrial settings, the types of safety controls in machine engineering are usually limited.
