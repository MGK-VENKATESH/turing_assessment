breakage of the actuator of the position switch B3. The probability of failure of the subsystems is calculated as follows. • S1 is a standard emergency stop device to EN ISO 13850. A B value of 100,000 switching cycles for each contact 10D can be substituted for emergency stop devices, irrespective of the load [S]. Three actuations per year is assumed for n . In consideration of the total switching operations of Q1 caused by actuation of the safeguards, this value is op not applied during further analysis of the two safety functions. • MTTF (guard 1, loading): switch B1 is a position switch with make contact. The B is 1 · 105 switching cycles [M]. D 10D For the position switch B2 with direct opening action and roller actuation, the B is 20 · 106 switching cycles [M]. 10D At 220 working days, 16 working hours per day and a cycle time of 10 minutes, n is 21,120 cycles per year for op these components, and the MTTF is 47.3 years for B1 and 9,469 years for B2. D For the contactor Q1, the B value corresponds under inductive load (AC 3) to an electrical durability of 1,000,000 10 switching cycles [M]. If 50% of failures are assumed to be dangerous, the B value is produced by doubling of the 10D B value. Since Q1 is involved in both safety-related stop functions, double the value assumed above for n yields 10 op an MTTF of 473 years. The MTTF for the frequency inverter T1 is 20 years [M]. Altogether, the symmetrized MTTF D D D value per channel in the subsystem Q1/T1 is 68.9 years (“high”). The position switch B1 exhibits a limited opera- tion time of 4.7 years. Its replacement in good time is recommended. • MTTF (guard
