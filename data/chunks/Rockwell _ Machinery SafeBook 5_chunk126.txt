under Solutions & Services > Safety Solutions. The following pre-engineered safety function is based on a door-monitioring interlock switch with a confi gurable safety relay. The products used are: SensaGuard RFID coded, non-contact safety interlock switch which is connected to a Guardmaster 440C-CR30 confi gurable safety relay. The output devices used are 100S-C safety contactors. The safety rating achieved by this pre-engineered safety function is: CAT. 4, PLe to (EN) ISO 13849-1. The publication number of the original document is: SAFETY-AT133C-EN-P Functional Safety Description Personnel are protected from the hazardous motion by a fi xed barrier. Access to the hazardous area, when necessary, is through a swinging door. The door is monitored by a SensaGuard non-contact interlock, which is connected to inputs of the 440C- CR30 confi gurable safety relay. The 440C-CR30 relay controls two 100S-C safety contactors which, connected in a series, control power to the motor that drives the hazardous motion. Whenever this monitored door is opened, the safety system 110 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Application Examples removes power to the motor. The motor and the hazardous motion it drives coast to a stop (Stop Category 0). The motor cannot be restarted while the monitored door is open. Once the door is closed, the motor can be restarted by pressing and releasing the Reset button to reset the 440C-CR30 relay and then initiating the external Start to restore the motor power that is controlled by the 100S-C contactors. The SensaGuard switch monitors the status (open or closed) of the door. The SensaGuard switch also monitors its two OSSD outputs for faults. The 440C-CR30 relay monitors the inputs from the SensaGuard switch for faults, and it also monitors the status of the Reset and Feedback signals from the 100S-C contactors. The relay monitors its own outputs for faults as well.
