machinery where there is no possibility of an operator or part of his body staying in or reaching into the danger zone while the guard is closed. The control guard must be the only access to the hazard area. 48 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Implementation of Protective Measures Safety Programmable Logic Controls The need for fl exible and scalable safety applications drove the development of safety PLCs/controllers. Programmable safety controllers provide users the same level of control fl exibility in a safety application that they are accustomed to with standard programmable controllers. However there are extensive differences between standard and safety PLCs. Safety PLCs come in various platforms to accommodate the scalability, functional and integration requirements of the more complex safety systems. Multiple microprocessors are used to process the I/O, memory, and safe communications. Watchdog circuits perform diagnostic analysis. This type of construction is known as 1oo2D, because either one of the two microprocessors can perform the safety function, and extensive diagnostics are performed to ensure that both microprocessors are operating in sync.

You may only hit the emergency stop once a month; but when you do, the internal circuit has been continuously tested. 49 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery Micro- processor Input 1 Test Address Data Input 2 Data Control Test Buffers SYNC WATCHDOG/ Input 3 COMPARE Test Address Data Test Control Control Circuit Micro- processor 50 SUB OI Safety input module block diagram Safety PLC outputs are electromechanical or safety rated solid state. Like the input circuits, the output circuits are tested multiple times
