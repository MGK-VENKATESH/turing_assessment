the valves 1V1 and 2V1. At 240 working days, D 10D 16 working hours and a cycle time of 15 seconds, n is 921,600 cycles per year. The MTTF for 1V1 and 2V1 is thus op D 217 years. A B value of 5,000,000 switching cycles [M] is substituted for the mechanical brake on the piston rod 10D 2Z1. This results in an MTTF of 54 years for the mechanical brake. Overall, the resulting symmetrized MTTF value D D per channel is 75 years (“high”). • DC : pressure monitoring of the control signal for the brake results in a DC of 99% for the control valve 2V1. The avg DC for the directional control valve 1V1 is 60% owing to fault detection through the process. Start-up testing of the mechanical brake yields a DC of 75% for 2Z1. Averaging thus produces a DC of 76.5% (“low”). avg • Adequate measures against common cause failure (85 points): separation (15), diversity (20), overvoltage protec- tion etc. (15) and environmental conditions (25 + 10) • The combination of the pneumatic control elements satisfies Category 3 with a high MTTF per channel (75 years) D and low DC (76.5%). This results in an average probability of dangerous failure of 1.1 · 10-7 per hour. This satisfies avg PL d. The addition of further SRP/CS in the form of subsystems for completion of the safety function may under certain circumstances result in a lower PL. • The wearing brake 2Z1 should be replaced at intervals of approximately five years (T ). 10D 145 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS More detailed reference • VDMA technical rule 24584: Safety functions of regulated and unregulated (fluid) mechanical systems (08.16) Figure 8.28: Determining of the PL by means of SISTEMA 146 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS 147 8
