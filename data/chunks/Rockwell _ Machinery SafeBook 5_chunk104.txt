PFH to determine the MTTF that D D is required by (EN) ISO 13849-1. That standard calls for the MTTF of a single D channel. This is a very different value to the MTTF of the combination of both D channels of a two channel subsystem including the effect of diagnostic coverage. Architectural Constraints The essential characteristic of IEC/EN 62061 is that the safety system is divided into subsystems. The hardware safety integrity level that can be claimed for a subsystem is limited not only by the PFH but also by the hardware fault tolerance D and the safe failure fraction of the subsystems. Hardware fault tolerance is the ability of the system to execute its function in the presence of faults. A fault tolerance of zero means that the function is not performed when a single fault occurs. A fault tolerance of one allows the subsystem to perform its function in the presence of a single fault. Safe Failure Fraction is the portion of the overall failure rate that does not result in a dangerous failure. The combination of these two elements is known as the architectural constraint and its output is the SIL Claim Limit (SIL CL). The following table shows the relationship of the architectural constraints to the SILCL. A subsystem (and therefore its system) must satisfy both the PFH requirements and the Architectural Constraints together with the other D relevant provisions of the standard. Safe Failure Hardware Fault Tolerance Fraction (SFF) 0 1 2 <60% Not allowed unless SIL1 SIL2 specifi c exceptions apply 60% - <90% SIL1 SIL2 SIL3 90% - < 99% SIL2 SIL3 SIL3 â‰¥99% SIL3 SIL3 SIL3 Architectural Constraints on SIL For example, a subsystem architecture that possesses single fault tolerance and has a safe failure fraction of 75% is limited to
