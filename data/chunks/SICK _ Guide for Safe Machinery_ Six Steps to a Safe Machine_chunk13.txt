or parts of the machinery or if harmonized standards have not been applied, conformity can only be achieved as follows: EC type examination by a notified body ° Use of a full quality management system (QMS) that has been assessed ° 14 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice § – LAWS, DIRECTIVES, STANDARDS Marking of the machine as conforming to the European directives (“CE conform”) Once all the requirements have been met and before the machine within the scope of the Machinery Directive is placed on the market, the CE marking shall be applied to the machine. NOTE The CE marking can only be affixed if the machine meets all applicable European directives. Only a machine with the CE marking is allowed to be placed on the market in the European Union. Special case: Partly completed machinery In many cases, parts of machines, machine assemblies, or machine components are manufactured and delivered that are very close to the definition of a machine but cannot be considered complete machines in the context of the Machinery Directive. The Machinery Directive defines as “partly completed machinery” an assembly of components that almost form a machine, but that on their own cannot perform any specific function. An individual industrial robot, for example, is a partly completed machine. A partly completed machine is only intended to be installed in other machinery or in other partly completed machinery or equipment, or to be combined with such machinery or equipment in order to form a machine in the context of the Directive. Partly completed machinery cannot meet all requirements of the Machinery Directive. Therefore, the Machinery Directive regulates their free trade using a special procedure: • The manufacturer shall meet all reasonably achievable essential health and safety requirements
