also foreseeable events and characteristics that can occur in the operating environment that could cause failure unless their effect is controlled. Annex G also provides measures for this. For example it is easily foreseeable that there may be occasional losses of power. Therefore the de- energisation of components must result in a safe state for the system. These measures may seem to be just common sense, and indeed they are, but they are nevertheless essential. All the rest of the requirements of the standard will be meaningless unless due consideration is given to the control and avoidance of systematic failure. This will also sometimes require the same types of measures used for the control of random hardware failure [in order to achieve the required PFH ] such as automatic diagnostic test and redundant hardware. D Fault Exclusion One of the primary analysis tools for safety systems is failure analysis. The designer and user must understand how the safety system performs in the presence of faults. Many techniques are available to perform the analysis. Examples include Fault Tree Analysis; Failure Modes, Effects and Criticality Analysis; Event Tree Analysis; and Load-Strength reviews. 83 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery During the analysis, certain faults may be uncovered that cannot be detected with automatic diagnostic testing without undue economic costs. Further, the probability that these faults might occur may be made extremely small because of mitigating design, construction and test methods. Under these conditions, the faults may be excluded from further consideration. Fault exclusion is the ruling out of the occurrence of a failure because the probability of that specifi c failure of the SRCS is negligible. (EN) ISO13849-1 allows fault exclusion based on the technical improbability of occurrence, generally accepted technical experience and the technical requirements related to the
