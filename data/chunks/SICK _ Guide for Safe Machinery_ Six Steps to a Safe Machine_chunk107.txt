This solution allows the operator to stand between the hazardous area and the AOPD without being detected. For this reason, additional safety measures shall be applied to reduce this risk. The control device (e.g., a reset button) must be positioned so that the entire hazardous area can be overseen. It must not be accessible from the hazardous area. 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 101 Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION S=1,106 mm Hazardous area 1,100 mm 700 mm Total stopping/run-down time of the system = 0.16 s S=1,600 × 0.16 + 850 S=1,106 mm 300 mm Figure 85: Determining the positioning and sizing of ESPE for access protection using a safety multibeam sensor and for a parallel approach Comparison of the results Table 38: Comparison of solution approaches, selection according to operational requirements Solution approach Advantages Disadvantages for stopping/run-down time = 0.16 s 1 Hazardous point protection • Increased productivity, as the oper‐ • Higher price for the protective S = 320 mm
