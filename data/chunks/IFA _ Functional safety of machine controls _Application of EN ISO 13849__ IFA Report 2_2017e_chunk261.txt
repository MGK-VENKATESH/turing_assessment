description • This example shows implementation of the SLS safety function with a frequency inverter without integrated safety function. The SLS safety function is used for example for inching mode during servicing tasks. • A hazardous movement is safely prevented or interrupted when the safety guard is open. Opening of the safety guard is detected by two position switches B1 and B2 employing a break-contact/make-contact element combi- nation. When the pushbutton S1 is actuated, a movement at a safely limited speed (inching mode) is initiated by means of the safety PLC K1. The two processing channels within the PLC each process a set limit value. The actual value of the limited speed on the inputs I3.0 and I3.1 of K1 is monitored by two separate rotary encoders G1 and G2. Each channel of the PLC performs the desired/actual speed comparison independently. Should the speed not be reduced successfully to the limited value by means of T1, K1 can initiate a halt by blocking the start/stop signal and servo enable on the frequency inverter. The power supply to T1 is also interrupted by the mains contactor relay Q1 after a programmed timeout. • The two-channel safety PLC K1 performs internal fault detection. Should one processing channel fail, the remaining (i.e. functioning) processing channel reduces the speed of the frequency inverter T1 and de-energizes the mains contactor relay Q1. A failure of the frequency inverter that could for example lead to unexpected start-up, continued running or an increase in the speed is detected by separate monitoring of the speed by the rotary encoders G1 and G2 in the two processing channels. Failure of the mains contactor relay Q1 to drop out is detected by the break- contact element connected to both processing channels (inputs I2.0 and I2.1 of K1), and leads both
