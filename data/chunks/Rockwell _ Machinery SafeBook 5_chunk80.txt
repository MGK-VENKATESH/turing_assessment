no longer adequate. In order to know whether a safety system is good enough we need to know more about it. This is why the functional safety standards ask for more information. As safety systems are using a more “black box” approach by integrating pre-qualifi ed subsystems we rely more heavily on their conformity to standards. Therefore those standards need to be capable of properly interrogating the technology. In order to fulfi l this they must speak to the basic factors of reliability, fault detection, architectural and systematic integrity. This is the intent of (EN) ISO 13849-1. In order to plot a logical course through the standard, two fundamentally different user types must be considered: the designer of safety-related subsystems and the designers of safety-related systems. In general the subsystem designer [typically a safety component manufacturer] will be subjected to a higher level of rigor. They will need to provide the required data in order that the system designer can ensure that the subsystem is of adequate integrity for the system. This will usually require some testing, analysis and calculation. The results will be expressed in the form of the data required by the standard. The system designer [typically a machine designer or integrator] will use the subsystem data to perform some relatively straightforward calculations as part of the determination of the overall performance level [PL] achieved by the system. 67 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery Determination of the safety function We need to decide what the safety function is. Clearly the safety function must be appropriate to the required task. How does the standard help us? It is important to realize that the functionality required can only be determined by considering the characteristics prevailing at the actual application. This can be regarded as the safety
