(technical protective measures) Risk reduction Special cases Press application § Unlike general standards, machine-specific C-type standards can contain special requirements. In particular for metal-working presses, the following requirements apply when following European and International standards: Calculation of the supplemental intrusion factor for presses Resolution d of the ESPE Supplement C Stroke initiation by ESPE/PSDI mode d ≤ 14 mm 0 mm Allowed 1 14 mm < d ≤ 20 mm 80 mm 20 mm < d ≤ 30 mm 130 mm 30 mm < d ≤ 40 mm 240 mm Not allowed 40 mm < d 850 mm - Press standards: EN 692, EN 693 (C-type standards) 2 ESPE for presence detection This type of protection is recommended for large systems that are accessible from the working surface (floor). In this special case, starting of the machine ("preventing start" safety function 3 g 3-4) must be prevented while there is an operator inside. This is a secondary protective device which detects the pres- c ence of people in the hazard zone and simultaneously prevents the machine switching to the dangerous state. In addition to the ESPE for presence detection, there shall be a primary protective measure for the "initiating a stop" safety function (g 3-3), e.g., in the form of another ESPE or a locked, mov- able guard. The minimum distance shall be calculated in this case for the main protective device (e.g., a vertical light curtain that has the task of stopping the machine).
