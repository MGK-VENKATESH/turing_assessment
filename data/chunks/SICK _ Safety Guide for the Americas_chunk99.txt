In addition to other measures that minimize risk (reduced force/speed, etc.), control devices are required that shall be actuated for the entire time the protective devices are disabled. Enabling devices are an option in such cases. 1 Enabling devices are physically actuated control switches which obtain the operator’s acknowledgement before allowing machine functions. Generally, pushbuttons or foot switches are used as enabling devices. Joysticks or inching buttons can be used as additional start controls for the enabling device. Having
