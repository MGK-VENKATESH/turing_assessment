Category 3 generally requires the use of two position switches for similar machine control systems. • For inching mode subject to the condition that safely limited speed is already guaranteed, the possibility of avoi- ding the hazard can be assumed under certain conditions. For risk assessment, refer also to Example 4 in Annex A. Calculation of the probability of failure • The three safety functions differ only on the sensor level. B1, G1 and S1 are therefore described separately. • The two contacts with direct opening action of B1 are integrated into the downstream Category 3 structure. A B 10D value of 20,000,000 cycles [S] is assumed per contact. At 10 actuations per week, n is 520 cycles per year and the op MTTF is 384,615 years. Under the particular requirements of EN 1010-1 for B1 (refer to the design features), a DC of D 60% (cross monitoring of input signals without dynamic test, infrequent signal change caused by the application) is assumed. • G1 and G2 are also each integrated into a channel of the downstream Category 3 structure. Their contribution to determining of the PFH is an MTTF of 30 years per channel [M], 90% DC for G2 by plausibility check and 99% DC D D for G1 by monitoring for sin2 + cos2 = 1, plausibility checking and fault detection in the process. • S1 possesses a B value of 100,000 cycles [M]. At 10 actuations per week, n is 520 cycles per year and the MTTF 10D op D is 1,923 years. Owing to the forced signal change and start-up warning, S1 is modelled as a Category 2 subsystem, and a DC of at least 60% is assumed (sticking following repeated inching is not detected, however). Testing is performed in K1 and K3, the probability of
