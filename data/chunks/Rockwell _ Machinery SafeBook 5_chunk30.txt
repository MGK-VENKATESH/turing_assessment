taken into account in order to estimate the amount of risk present. 25 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery ISO TR 14121-2 “Risk assessment – Practical guidance and examples of methods” shows different methods for quantifi cation of risk. There are differences in the terminology and scoring systems but all the methods relate to the principles given in (EN) ISO 12100. The following text outlines the basic risk quantifi cation principles and is intended to provide help regardless of which methodology is used. It generally follows the parameters given at the Hybrid Tool at clause 6.5 of ISO TR 14121-2. The following factors are taken into account: • THE SEVERITY OF POTENTIAL INJURY. • THE PROBABILITY OF ITS OCCURRENCE. The probability of occurrence includes at least two factors: • FREQUENCY OF EXPOSURE. • PROBABILITY OF INJURY. The probability factor itself is often split into other factors such as: • PROBABILITY OF OCCURRENCE. • POSSIBILITY OF AVOIDANCE. Make use of any data and expertise available to you. You are dealing with all stages of machine life, so to avoid too much complexity base your decisions on the worst case for each factor. It is also important to retain common sense. Decisions need to take account of what is feasible, realistic and plausible. This is where a cross functional team approach is valuable. At this stage you should usually not take account of any existing protective system. If this risk estimation shows that a protective system is required there are some methodologies as shown later in this chapter that can be used to determine the characteristics required. Severity of potential injury For this consideration we are presuming that the accident or incident has occurred. Careful study of the hazard will reveal what is the most severe injury possible. Remember:
