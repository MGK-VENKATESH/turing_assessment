must be carried out in the specified order (see figure 127, page 160): Table 59: Steps of the methodology for evaluating significant modifications in machinery Step Description Step 1 Determine if the modifications will result in the occurrence of new hazards. If newly identified hazards result in significant risks, follow Step 3; otherwise, the modifications are considered to be non-substantial. Step 2 If no new hazards have been identified and the modifications do not increase any of the existing risks, the changes are considered non-substantial. If pre-existing risks are increased by the modifi‚Äê cations, follow Step 3. 158 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice üè≠ RESPONSIBILITY OF THE USER Step Description Step 3 The modifications are considered not to be significant if the existing risk reduction measures adequately reduce the risks arising from the new hazards (Step 1) or from the increased risks (Step 2). Otherwise, follow Step 4. Step 4 If the new hazards are eliminated by simple protective devices or by simple integration of additional protective devices, or if the increased risk is adequately reduced, the modifications are considered not to be significant. Otherwise, the modification is considered to be significant. If a modification is considered significant, a risk assessment and risk reduction must be performed in accordance with ISO 12100:2010, but may be limited to those parts and/or zones affected by the modification. Simple protective devices are: ‚Ä¢ Fixed physical guards or ‚Ä¢ Movable physical guards, or non-physical guards that do not significantly interfere with the existing safety- related control of the machine. The simple integration of additional protective devices is limited to those that also do not significantly interfere with the existing safety-related parts of control systems (SRP/CS) of the machine: ‚Ä¢ The signals of the new
