not cause an immediate loss of safety function may not be detected. This means that for Category 3 an accumulation of undetected faults can lead to the loss of the safety function.

Redundancy combined with cross monitoring and output monitoring are used to ensure the performance of the safety function 100 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety-Related Control Systems, Additional Considerations +V SCP K1 L1 L2 L3 Aux K2 SCP Start Aux Ch2 Stop K1 Ch1 Monitoring Safety Ch1 K2 Relay Ch2 Guard OP Closed Tongue Switch TS K1 K2 TS Motor (Hazard) Gnd Contactors Category 3 Safety System Shown here is an example of a Category 3 system. The tongue interlock switch has redundant sets of contacts. Internally, the monitoring safety relay (MSR) contains redundant circuits that cross monitor each other. A redundant set of contactors remove power from the motor. The contactors are monitored by the MSR via the mechanically linked contacts. Fault detection must be considered for each part of the safety system. What are the failure modes of a dual channel tongue switch? What are the failure modes of the MSR? What are the failure modes of the contactors K1 and K2? What are the failure modes of the wiring? For Category 3 circuits it is common practice to use single tongue interlock switches with redundant electrical contact sets. This means that the possibility that a fault of a single component within the actuation linkage must be excluded. If this fault cannot be excluded it means that a single fault can cause the loss of the safety function. It is very important that any fault exclusion is fully justifi ed.
