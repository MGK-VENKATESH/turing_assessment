• the power control element(s) If no type-C standard exists for the particular machine or the type-C standard does not contain any requirements relating to this, the required safety level can be determined on the basis of one of the following standards: NOTE - ISO 13849-1 - IEC 62061 By applying these standards it can be ensured that the effort required to reduce the risk is reasonable for the risk that has been determined. The protection of an operator who manually inserts and removes parts at a metal press requires a different risk reduction compared to the protection of an operator who works on a machine on which the maximum risk is the trapping of a finger. Safety functions shall be specified individually for each phase of the machine’s life cycle and hazard, since one and the same machine can have different hazardous points with different risks during different phases of the lifecycle. The risk assessment is based on the following parameters: • The severity of the possible injury/damage to health • Frequency and/or duration of exposure • The possibility of preventing the hazard By combining these parameters, the required safety level can be determined. Some standards contain suitable methods for this determination. The risk assessment always starts without considering risk reduction measures. Required performance level (PLr) according to ISO 13849-1 This standard uses a risk graph to determine the required risk reduction level. The parameters S, F and P are used to determine the magnitude of the risk. The result of the procedure is a “required performance level” (PLr). 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 51 Subject to change without notice Severity of injury Frequency and/or Possibility of avoiding the PLr – required S1: Mild duration of exposure to hazard or limiting the performance level
