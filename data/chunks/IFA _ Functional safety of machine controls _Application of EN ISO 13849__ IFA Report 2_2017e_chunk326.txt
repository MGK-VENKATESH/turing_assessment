the entrapment point is protected by a guard door (safeguar- ding). The following safety functions are implemented: • SF1 – Opening of the guard door during operation causes the cylinders to be braked to a halt. • SF2 – When the guard door is open, any machine move- ments must be performed at limited speed. • SF3 – When the guard door is open, movements are possible only whilst an inching button is pressed. Entrapment between the cylinders causes severe injuries Required (S2). Since tasks are performed in the hazard zone only performance during maintenance work, the frequency of exposure to Low risk level PLr the hazard can be described as low (less frequently than P1 a F1 once every 15 minutes); the entire exposure duration is lower than 1/20 of the entire operation time (F1). At Starting- S1 P2 P1 b point for F2 production speeds, no possibility exists of avoiding the P1 P2 c SF3 hazard (P2). This therefore results in a required Perfor- estimation F1 mance Level PL r of d for the safety functions SF1 and SF2 of the risk S2 P2 P1 d SF1, SF2 (see Figure A.4). The safety function SF3 can however be reduction F2 used only if the printing press has first been halted (SF1) P2 e and the permissible rotational speed of the cylinders High risk limited (SF2). This results in the possible machine move- ments being predictable for the operator, who is thus able S2 − Serious, generally irreversible injury F1 − Infrequent or short exposure to evade hazardous movements (P1). A required Perfor- P1 − Evasion of the hazardous situation possible P2 − Evasion of the hazardous situation virtually impossible mance Level PL of c is therefore adequate for SF3 (see r Figure A.4).
