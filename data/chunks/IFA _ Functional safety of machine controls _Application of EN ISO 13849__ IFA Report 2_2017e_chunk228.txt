The MTTF of D D the test channel is thus 32.3 years. The MTTF of the functional channel must therefore be reduced to 64.5 years in D accordance with the underlying analysis model. • DC : the DC of 60% for 1V3 is based upon the comparison of the distance/time characteristic of the hazardous avg movement in conjunction with the switching status of the directional control valve. This is also the DC (“low”). avg • Adequate measures against common cause failure (85 points): separation (15), diversity (20), overvoltage protec- tion etc. (15) and environmental conditions (25 + 10) 137 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS • The combination of the control elements satisfies Category 2 with a high MTTF (75 years) and low DC (60%). D avg This results in an average probability of dangerous failure of 8.7 · 10-7 per hour. This satisfies PL d. The addition of further SRP/CS in the form of subsystems for completion of the safety function may under certain circumstances result in a lower PL.
