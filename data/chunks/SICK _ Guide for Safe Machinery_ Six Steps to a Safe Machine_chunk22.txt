account when designing and constructing the machine (risk reduction). The risk assessment should help to reduce or avoid risks. As a consequence it may identify necessary measures to protect the operator from hazards. If necessary, the risk assessment process must be repeated several times. The first process steps are intended to identify and assess hazards. This is followed by an evaluation and, if necessary, risk mitigation. If the measure triggers a new hazard, the repeated risk assessment reveals this. Being machine-related and application-specific, the risk assessment is already specified in many type-C standards. If this is not the case or not applicable, the requirements of the type-A and type-B standards can be used.
