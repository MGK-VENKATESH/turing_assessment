It is not intended to form an exhaustive list but rather to give an insight on what machinery safety issues are the subject of standardization. This section should be read in conjunction with the Regulation section. The countries of the world are working towards global harmonization of standards. This is especially evident in the area of machine safety. Global safety standards for machinery are governed by two organizations: ISO and IEC. Regional and country standards are still in existence and continue to support local requirements but in many countries there has been a move toward using the international standards produced by ISO and
