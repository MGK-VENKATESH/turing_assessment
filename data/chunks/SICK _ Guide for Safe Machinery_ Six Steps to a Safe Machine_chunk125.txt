A bus system makes wiring Loss easier and as a result reduces the possible errors. It Sender Receiver is reasonable to use bus systems already used in the market for safety-related applications. Insertion An examination of the hardware and software errors Sender Receiver that arise in transmission systems shows that these errors lead to the following transmission errors in bus systems: Wrong order • Repetition Sender Receiver • Loss • Insertion Corruption • Wrong sequence • Corruption Sender Receiver • Data delay Transmission errors can be avoided using various Delay measures in the higher-level control system, e.g., by Sender Receiver sequential numbering of the safety-related telegrams Source: Safety in Construction and Design of Printing and Paper Converting Machines – or a time expectation for incoming telegrams with Electrical Equipment and Control Systems, BG Druck- und Papierverarbeitung (today BG ETEM); Edition 06/2004; page 79 acknowledgment. Protocol extensions based on the Figure 98: Transmission errors of bus systems. field-bus used include such measures. In the ISO/OSI layer model, they act over the transport layer and, therefore, use the field-bus with all its com‐ ponents as a “black channel”, without modification. Examples of established safe bus systems are: • Actuator Sensor Interface Safety at Work • DeviceNet CIP Safety™ • PROFIsafe 116 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice Selection criteria The criteria for the selection of a control system model are initially the number of safety functions to be imple‐ mented as well as the scope of the logical operators on the input signals.
