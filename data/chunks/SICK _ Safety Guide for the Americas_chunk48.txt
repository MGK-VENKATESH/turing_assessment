ratings Typically electrical equipment enclosures need to meet the and their type number system is commonly specified at instal- requirement for enclosure ratings. Two widely accepted rating lations in the U.S and is similar to UL and CSA equivalents. IP, systems are the NEMA types/number and the IP rating code. which is an abbreviation for International Protection, is derived NEMA, short for National Electric Manufacturersâ€™ Association, from the IEC. Typically control cabinets should be NEMA 13. The NEMA classifications are as follows. 1 Standard NEMA NEMA 1 NEMA 2 NEMA 3 NEMA 3S NEMA 4 NEMA 4X NEMA 6 NEMA 6P NEMA 12 NEMA 13 Suggested Usage Inside Inside Outside Outside Inside or Inside or Inside or Inside or Inside Inside Outside Outside Outside Outside Accidental Bodily 2 Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Contact Falling Dirt Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Dust, Lint, Fibers Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes (non volatile) Windblown Dust Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Falling Liquid and Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Light Splash Hosedown and Yes Yes Yes Yes Heavy Splash Rain, Snow and Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Sleet Ice Buildup Yes Oil or Coolant Yes Yes Seepage Oil or Coolant Yes Spray and Wash Occasional Yes Yes Submersion Prolonged Yes Submersion Corrosive Agents Yes Yes 2-8 GUIDE FOR SAFE MACHINERY | SICK 7028282/2014-09-08 Subject to change without notice Risk reduction Safe design The enclosure IP ratings describe the protection of an item of required, even at low voltages.
