however. For PL c to be attained, the number of light barriers would for example have to be reduced, or compo- nents with a higher MTTF employed. D • In consideration of the estimation erring on the safe side as described above, an operation time (T ) of 17 years is 10D produced for specified replacement of the wearing component Q1.
