An evaluation of the measures gives them a score Separation 15 of 75. This meets the minimum requirement.

For example: • Organization and competence l • Rules governing design (e.g., specification templates, coding guidelines) • Test concept and test criteria • Documentation and configuration management 7) Result From the illustration for the determination of the PL for the subsystem 3 (g 3-81), the PL for the subsystem can be determined. In this case, 3 the PL is "e." d The resulting PFHd figure of 2.47 × 10–8 for this subsystem can be d taken from a detailed table in ISO 13849-1. The high DC means that the dual-channel structure meets the requirements of Category 4. 3-88 GUIDE FOR SAFE MACHINERY | SICK 7028282/2014-09-08 Subject to change without notice )LP( level ecnamrofreP 10-4 a b c d e PFHd value 10-5 10-6 10-7 10-8 DC None None Low Medium Low Medium High Category B 1 2 2 3 3 4 - With the resulting data for the subsystem, it is now possible to determine the performance level of the entire safety func-
