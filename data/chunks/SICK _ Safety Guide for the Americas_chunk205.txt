senses that work motions of the operator related to feeding or removing parts are completed and all parts of the operator’s body are withdrawn from the sensing field of the device (ANSI B11.19). R Reset Resetting the protective device to the monitored status. - 3-43 • Manual reset is provided by a separate device to be operated manually, e.g., - 3-64 using a reset button. • Automatic reset by the protective device is only permitted in exceptional cases: It must not be possible for persons to be in the hazard zone without the protec- tive device triggering or it must be ensured there are no people in the hazard zone during and after reset. Resolution/Sensor detection capability The limit for the sensor parameter that causes the electro-sensitive protective - 3-30 equipment (g ESPE) to respond. It is defined by the manufacturer. Response time The maximum time between the occurrence of an event which activates the sen- - 3-44 sor unit and the switching outputs (g OSSDs) being switched to the OFF state. Restart Putting the machine back into operation. After the triggering of the protective - 3-64 function or after a fault, the protective device can be reset to make it possible to subsequently restart the machine. Restart interlock Means of preventing automatic restarting of a machine following triggering of the - 3-55 safety function during a dangerous part of the machine operating cycle, after a change in the operating mode of the machine, and after a change to the device used to control starting of the machine (IEC 61496-1/EN 61496-1). • Operating modes include: inching, single stroke, automatic • Startup control devices include: foot switch, two-hand control device, single- break PSDI triggering or double-break PSDI triggering by the ESPE’s sensor i function • Restart interlock (RES): The machine stops
