Conversely, for a machining centre that is set up once each year and then • P – possibility of avoiding the hazard or of limiting the operates automatically, F1 will doubtless be selected. For harm evaluation of the frequency and duration of exposure to the hazard, cases in which the same person or different The risk graph thus leads to the necessary PL.

Where other technical measures are in place that (parameter P) are implemented independently of the control system, such as a mechanical guard or further safety functions, At this point, an evaluation must be made of whether they can be assumed to be effective for the purpose of recognition and avoidance of a hazardous situation is: determining the PL. r • P1 – possible under specific conditions Severity of injury S1 and S2 • P2 – scarcely possible Generally, the severity of injury (parameter S) in a hazard Aspects relevant to definition of this parameter include zone will be found to vary widely.
