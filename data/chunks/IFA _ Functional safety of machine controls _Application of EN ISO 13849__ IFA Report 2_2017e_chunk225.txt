value of 50 years [E] is assumed for the PLC K1. A B value of 20,000,000 cycles [S] applies for the D 10D exhaust valve 0V1. At actuation once daily on 240 working days, the MTTF value for 0V1 is 833,333 years. The D MTTF of the test channel is thus 37.5 years. D • DC : the DC of 60% for 1V1 is based upon comparison of the distance/time characteristic of the hazardous move- avg ment in conjunction with the switching status of the directional control valve. This is also the DC (“low”). avg • Adequate measures against common cause failure (85 points): separation (15), diversity (20), overvoltage protec- tion etc. (15) and environmental conditions (25 + 10) • The combination of the pneumatic control elements satisfies Category 2 with a high MTTF (72.3 years) and low D DC (60%). This results in an average probability of dangerous failure of 7.6 · 10-7 per hour. This satisfies PL d. avg The addition of further SRP/CS in the form of subsystems for completion of the safety function may under certain circumstances result in a lower PL. The wearing element 1V1 should be replaced approximately every seven years (T ). 10D More detailed reference • VDMA technical rule 24584: Safety functions of regulated and unregulated (fluid) mechanical systems (08.16) Figure 8.22: Determining of the PL by means of SISTEMA 134 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS 135 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS 8.2.12 Tested hydraulic valve (subsystem) – Category 2 – PL d (Example 12) K1 1S3 G hazardous 1A movement 1S3 1V3b 1V3a K1 K1 1V3 K1 Inputs a b PLC Outputs Q1 L 1V2 Q1 1V1 1Z2 1Z1 M 1S1 1S2 Figure 8.23: 1M 1P 3 Hydraulic valve with electronic testing for the control of hazardous movements Safety functions •
