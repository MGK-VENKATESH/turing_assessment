to the in-depth technical details but will have access to every detail of the machines working environment. Ideally the output of one iteration will be the input for the next iteration. Machine Limit Determination This involves collecting and analysing information regarding the parts, mechanisms and functions of a machine. It will also be necessary to consider all the types of human task interaction with the machine and the environment in which the machine will operate. The objective is to get a clear understanding of the machine and its usage. Where separate machines are linked together, either mechanically or by control systems, they should be considered as a single machine, unless they are “zoned” by appropriate protective measures. It is important to consider all limits and stages of the life of a machine including installation, commissioning, maintenance, decommissioning, correct use and operation as well as the consequences of reasonably foreseeable misuse or malfunction. 24 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety Strategy Task and Hazard Identifi cation All the hazards at the machine must be identifi ed and listed in terms of their nature and location. Types of hazard include crushing, shearing, entanglement, part ejection, fumes, radiation, toxic substances, heat, noise, etc. The results of the task analysis should be compared with the results of the hazard identifi cation. This will show where there is a possibility for the convergence of a hazard and a person i.e. a hazardous situation. All the hazardous situations should be listed. It may be possible that the same hazard could produce different types of hazardous situations depending on the nature of the person or the task. For example, the presence of a highly skilled and trained maintenance technician may have different implications than the presence of an unskilled cleaner who has no knowledge of the machine. In this
