at Step 9. Step 9: Grouping blocks of the same category Subsystems of the same category can be merged by the grouping of components of identical channels (see BGIA Report 2/2008, Figure 6.14). Each component occurs only once within a channel; duplicates can be removed. The same component clearly cannot be used simulta- neously in two redundant functional channels. In Category 2, only components which share the same test channel can be grouped in a functional channel. Since SISTEMA limits MTTF values of each channel within the subsystems (capping), d grouping may result in a lower probability of a dangerous failure per hour being calculated. The lower probability of failure (PFH) is an advantage. A disadvantage however is that the grouped representation often makes it more difficult to follow the logical sequence of signal processing. The examples in Chapter 2 yield the safety-related block diagrams in Figure 5a: Figure 5a: Result of the structural analysis for the examples from Chapter 2 The safety function is now presented logically on the safety-related block diagram. In the next chapter, the probability of failure (PFH) is calculated with the aid of SISTEMA.
