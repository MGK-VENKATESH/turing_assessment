The result is a so-called risk index. This is mapped to the safety levels of ISO 13849-1 (PL) and IEC 62061 (SIL) (see table 4, page 26). A separate risk estimation in accordance with ISO 13849-1, Annex A is not required when using SCRAM. 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 25 Subject to change without notice Table 4: Correspondence of the SCRAM risk index to the required safety level Risk index < 1 1 2 – 3 4 – 7 8 – 10 PLr a b c d e (ISO 13849-1) SIL ÷ 1 2 3 (IEC 62061) The table 5 allows the estimation of the effectiveness of the implemented technical protective measures and/or information for use provided.
