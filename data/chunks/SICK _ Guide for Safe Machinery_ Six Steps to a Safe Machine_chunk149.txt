and test criteria • Documentation and configuration management The process for the correct implementation of safety-relevant topics is part of the remit of managers and includes appropriate quality management. Determination of the PL of a subsystem The following figure shows the relationship between the MTTF value (per channel), the DC, and the category of D safety-related parts of controllers.

This can be achieved either with components of good quality (MTTF = medium) if almost all errors are detected (DC = D medium) or with components of very good quality (MTTF = high) if many errors are detected (DC = low). D A complex mathematical model underlies this procedure. To ensure a pragmatic approach, the parameters cate‐ gory, MTTF and DC are predefined.

As the contactor contacts are positively guided, a safety-relevant failure of the contactors can be detected (EDM). The UE410 logic unit is not itself part of the “power control element” subsystem, but it is used for diagnostics purposes. 2) Determination of the category I1 Input L1
