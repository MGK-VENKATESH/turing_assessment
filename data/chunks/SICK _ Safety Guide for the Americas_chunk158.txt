c • According to this method, adding another subsystem with a d ≤ 3 d PL of e would reduce the overall PL to d. > 3 d Example 2: e ≤ 3 e 3 • One subsystem achieves a PL of d, two subsystems achieve 3 a PL of c. The PL (low) is, therefore, c. d • The number of subsystems with this PL is 2 (i.e., ≤2). There- d fore, the overall PL achieved is c. - If the PL is not known for all subsystems, the safety level can be determined as described in the section titled "Determining the safety level of a subsystem according to ISO 13849-1" below. Detailed method An essential – but not exclusive – criterion for determining the The manufacturer of a safety component may also have applied PL is the "probability of a dangerous failure per hour" (PFHd) of additional structural restrictions that must also be taken into the safety components. The resulting PFHd value is made up of account in the overall consideration. the sum of the individual PFHd values. - If the PFHd value is not known for all subsystems, its safety level can be determined.
