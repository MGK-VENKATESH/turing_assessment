VBPDs Detection is signaled by a signal change (OFF state) to its out- that use ambient light are also possible. put signal switching devices (OSSDs). These signals from the Various principles can be used to detect people, including: OSSDs are used to stop the hazardous machine functions. • Interruption of the light reflected by a retro-reflector A safety laser scanner is an optical sensor which monitors • Travel time measurement of the light reflected by an object a hazard zone on a machine or vehicle by scanning the area • Monitoring of changes from background patterns around it on a single plane with infrared light beams. • Detection of persons based on human characteristics It works on the basis of the principle of time-of-flight measure- ment (see the figure below). The scanner sends very short light pulses (S) while an "electronic stopwatch" runs simultaneously. If the light strikes an object, it is reflected and received by the scanner (R). The scanner calculates the distance from the ob- ject from the difference between the send and receive times. A uniformly rotating mirror (M) in the scanner deflects the light pulses such that a sector of a circle is covered. The scanner then determines the exact position of the object from the mea- 3 sured distance and the angle of rotation of the mirror. c Camera-based protective device The future international standard series IEC 61496-4 will state safety requirements for VBPDs. Basic structure of a laser scanner The user can program the area in which object detection trips the protective field. State-of-the-art devices allow multiple areas to be monitored simultaneously as well as switching between these
