contact protection) as described in the initial paragraphs of Chapter 8 are implemented. The closed-circuit current principle of the undervoltage release is employed as the basic safety principle. • The emergency stop device S1 is a switch with positive mode of actuation in accordance with IEC 60947-5-5, and is therefore a well-tried component in accordance with Table D.3 of EN ISO 13849-2. • The motor starter Q1 is to be considered equivalent to a circuit breaker in accordance with Table D.3 of EN ISO 13849-2. Q1 may therefore be regarded as a well-tried component. • The power supply to the entire machine is switched off (stop Category 0 to IEC 60204-1). Remarks • The function for stopping in an emergency is a protective measure that complements the safety functions for the safeguarding of hazard zones. 120 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS S1 Q1 Calculation of the probability of failure • MTTF : S1 is a standard emergency stop device according to EN ISO 13850. It is manufactured in accordance with D IEC 60947-5-5. In accordance with EN ISO 13849-1, Table C.1, a B value of 100,000 switching cycles may be 10D applied in this case for emergency stop devices, irrespective of the load [S]. For the undervoltage release of the motor starter Q1, the B value approximates to the electrical durability of 10,000 switching cycles [M]. On the 10 assumption that 50% of failures are dangerous, the B value is produced by doubling of the B value. At actua- 10D 10 tion of the emergency stop device twelve times a year and a resulting n of 12 cycles per year, Q1 has an MTTF of op D 16,666 years. This is also the MTTF for the channel, which is capped to 100 years (“high”). D • DC and measures against
