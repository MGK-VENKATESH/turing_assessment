to supply the complete technical documentation to the purchaser (user) of the machine. Risk assessment using Safexpert® Figure 11: Risk assessment using the Safexpert® software from company ibf The risk assessment process is also included in Safexpert®, a CE management software from company ibf. The user is guided through the legal requirements and the requirements in the standards. This task is simplified by the pre-defined list of hazards, the CE management software from ibf for structured risk assessment, and the scheme for evaluating both the risk and the level of safety necessary in control systems. The necessary standards are always kept up to date with the StandardManager and the update assistants. The hazards are evaluated separately at each hazardous point and for each phase of the machine’s life cycle. Evaluating hazards individually enables the ideal measures for risk reduction to be selected in each case. Safexpert® uses a combination of risk graphs and matrices (tables). The estimation is made before (IN) and after (OUT) the protective measure (e.g., protective device) has been selected. The risk is categorized on a scale from 0 (no risk) to 10 (highest risk). 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 27 Subject to change without notice 1 – RISK ASSESSMENT Figure 12: Risk graph for evaluating hazards using the Safexpert® software from ibf NOTE Safexpert® is not only used for risk assessment. Using Safexpert®, every aspect of the conformity process according to the Machinery Directive can be completed and documented efficiently. Summary: Risk assessment General • Perform a risk assessment for all hazards. This iterative process must take into account all hazards and risks until there are no residual risks or only acceptable residual risks remain. Risk assessment process • Start the risk assessment by establishing the functions and the limits of
