and electromagnetic disturbances against common cause failures that cannot occur owing (EMC) in accordance with appropriate standards to the inherent characteristics of the control system. – Fluid power systems: filtration of the pressure The measures against common cause failures and the medium, prevention of dirt intake, drainage of associated numbers of points from EN ISO 13849-1 are as compressed air, for example in compliance with the follows: component manufacturer's requirements for purity of the pressure medium • Separation/segregation (15 points): physical separation between the signal paths, e.g.: On combined fluid power and electrical systems, both aspects should be considered. – Separation in wiring/piping • Environmental conditions with regard to other influen- – Detection of short-circuits and open circuits by ces (10 points): consideration of the requirements for dynamic testing immunity to all relevant environmental conditions, such as temperature, shock, vibration, humidity (for example – Separate shielding for the signal path of each as specified in the relevant standards) channel Reference – Sufficient clearances and creepage distances on printed-circuit boards [1] IEC 61508-6: Functional safety of electrical/elec- tronic/programmable electronic safety-related • Diversity (20 points): different technologies/design or systems – Part 6: Guidelines on the application of physical principles are used. Examples include: IEC 61508-2 and IEC 61508-3 (2010) – One channel electronic or programmable electronic, the other electromechanical hard-wired – Different initiation of the safety function for each channel, for example by means of position, pressure or temperature – Digital and analogue measurement of variables (e.g. distance, pressure or temperature) – Sourcing of components from different manufac- turers • Design/application/experience: protection against overvoltage, overpressure, overcurrent, overtempera- ture, etc. (15 points) and the use of well-tried compo- nents (5 points) 294 Annex G: What is the significance of the bar chart in Figure 5 of EN ISO 13849-1?
