In zone, two AOPDs are used: a vertical AOPD positioned at the either case, the optimal minimum distance is achieved by using calculated minimum distance (perpendicular approach), and a a safety light curtain with the best possible combination of horizontal AOPD to eliminate the danger of standing behind the resolution and response time. vertical AOPD.
