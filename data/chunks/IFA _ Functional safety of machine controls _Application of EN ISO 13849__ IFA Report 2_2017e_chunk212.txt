common cause failures are not relevant in Category 1. avg • The electromechanical control system satisfies Category 1 with a high MTTF (100 years). This results in an average D probability of dangerous failure of 1.1 · 10-6 per hour. This satisfies PL c.

Functional description • Interruption of a light beam of the n cascaded light barriers F1 to Fn triggers a de-energization command both by relays, by de-energization of the contactor relay K2, and via the PLC output (O1.1) of the test channel. The hazardous movement is then halted by means of the main contactor relay Q1. • The light barriers are tested before each start of the hazardous movement following pressing of the start button
