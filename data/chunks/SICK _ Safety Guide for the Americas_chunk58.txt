Examples: • Safety cover with special observation window on a milling machine for protection from flying chips and parts of work- pieces (see figure) 1 • Fence that can retain a robot arm 3 a Initiating a stop A safety-related stop function places the machine in a safe state on demand (e.g., approach of a person). To reduce the required stopping time, a stop function which complies with stop Category 1 (NFPA 79 and EN 60204-1 g 2-11) may be applied. Additional safety functions may be necessary to pre- vent unexpected start-up. Examples: • Opening a protective door with an interlock that has no lock- ing function • Interrupting the light beams on a multiple light beam safety device providing access protection (see figure) 7028282/2014-09-08 GUIDE FOR SAFE MACHINERY | SICK 3-3 Subject to change without notice Technical protective measures Risk reduction Avoiding unexpected startup After actuating the “initiating a stop” function or
