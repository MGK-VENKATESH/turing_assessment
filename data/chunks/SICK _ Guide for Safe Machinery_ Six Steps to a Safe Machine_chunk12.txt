Machinery Directive are subject to the standard process. The “Essential health and safety requirements” described in Annex I must be met. The manufacturer shall then compile the technical files and apply the CE marking. This process does not require the involvement of a third party (test body or authority). The technical files shall be provided to the national market authorities upon duly reasoned request. Figure 7: Safeguarding of a machine and diagnostics on the protective device • Procedure for machinery that is listed in Annex IV: Machines that are particularly hazardous are subject to special procedures. Annex IV of the Machinery Directive contains a list of particularly hazardous machinery and also safety components; this list includes electro-sensitive protective equipment such as photoelectric safety switches and safety laser scanners. The “Essential health and safety requirements” in Annex I of the Machinery Directive must be met first. If applicable harmonized standards covering all relevant health and safety requirements are available for the machinery or safety components, the declaration of conformity can then be obtained in one of the following three ways: Self-certification by the standard procedure ° EC type examination by a notified body: A notified body tests whether the machine meets the relevant ° essential health and safety requirements applicable to the machinery or the safety component. On com‐ pliance with those requirements, the notified body issues an EC type examination certificate containing the results of the tests. Use of a full quality management system that has been assessed (QMS): The full QMS shall ensure ° conformity with the requirements of the Machinery Directive and be assessed by a notified body. The manufacturer is responsible for the effective and appropriate use of the QMS. See also Annex X of the Machinery Directive. If no applicable harmonized standards exist for the machinery
