and Q2, dropping out of which interrupts or prevents hazardous movements or states. • The position switches are monitored for plausibility in K1 for the purpose of fault detection. Faults in Q1 and Q2 are detected by a start-up test in K1. A start command is successful only if Q1 and Q2 had previously dropped out. Start- up testing by opening and closing of the guard is not required. 226 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS B1 Q1 K1 B2 Q2 • The safety function remains intact in the event of a component failure. Faults are detected during operation or at actuation (opening and closing) of the guard by the dropping out of Q1 and Q2 and operating inhibition. • An accumulation of more than two faults in the period between two successive actuations can lead to loss of the safety function. Design features • Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. Protective circuits (such as contact protection) as described in the initial paragraphs of chapter 8 are implemented. • A stable arrangement of the guards is assured for actuation of the position switches. • The switch B1 is a position switch with direct opening action in accordance with IEC 60947-5-1, Annex K. • The supply conductors to position switches B1 and B2 are laid separately or with protection. • The safety module K1 satisfies all requirements for Category 4 and PL e. • The contactors Q1 and Q2 possess mirror contacts in accordance with IEC 60947-4-1, Annex F. Remarks • Category 4 is not observed if several mechanical position switches for different guards are cascaded (connected in a series arrangement), since this limits fault detection in the switches (see Annex E). Calculation of the probability of failure • The circuit arrangement can
