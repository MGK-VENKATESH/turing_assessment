safe side at 0%. The resulting DC value is 63% (“low”). avg • Adequate measures against common cause failure (65 points): separation (15), overvoltage protection etc. (15) and environmental conditions (25 + 10) • The combination of the control elements satisfies Category 3 with a high MTTF of each channel (35 years) and a D low DC (63%). This results in an average probability of dangerous failure PFH of 5.2 · 10-7 per hour. This satisfies avg D PL d.
