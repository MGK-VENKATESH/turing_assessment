The purpose of Shuttle has (according to NASA) fewer than one error per these calculations is to determine the residual error pro- 10,000 lines. What does this mean in practice? A mobile bability R, and from it the residual error rate Λ (derived telephone has up to 200,000 lines of code and therefore from the lower-case λ for the failure rate for components). up to 600 software errors. A PC operating system has Exactly this value can then be calculated as the average 27 million lines of code and therefore up to 50,000 errors; probability of a dangerous failure per hour required for a the Space Shuttle up to 300 errors; and the software for PL as a proportion for the transmission of safety-relevant the Space Defense Initiative (SDI) up to 10,000 errors. messages. Both of the above publications limit the resi- These programming errors lie dormant in the products dual error rate to 1% of the maximum permissible value until, under certain conditions and in certain situations, for the probability of a dangerous failure per hour. Values they impact upon the products' function. Like no other stated by manufacturers are in fact frequently related to technology, software and therefore also its programmers an SIL (see Chapter 3); in practice, however, these values assume a greater responsibility than ever before. are compatible for use under a required PL (see also Figure 3.2). The 1% rule results in the contribution to the One of the essential changes in EN ISO 13849-1 compared probability of a dangerous failure per hour being virtually to its predecessor, EN 954-1, was the formulation for the negligible, i.e. it enables it to be added to
