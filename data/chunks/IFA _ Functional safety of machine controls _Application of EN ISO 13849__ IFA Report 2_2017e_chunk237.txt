in 1V5 can be detected via the process owing to the function. An accumulation of undetected faults in the hydraulic part of the control system may lead to loss of the safety function. 148 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS 1V3 1V4 F1 K1 1V5 1S3 Design features • Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. Protective circuits (such as contact protection) as described in the initial paragraphs of Chapter 8 are implemented. • Faults in the conductors to F1 and K1 must not be hazardous in their effects. For this purpose, faults are detected as they arise, and the safe state is initiated. Alternatively, fault exclusion to EN ISO 13849-2, Table D.4 must be possible for conductor short circuits. • The laser scanner F1 and safety PLC K1 are tested safety components for use in PL d that satisfy Category 3 and the relevant product standards. • The directional control valve 1V5 features a closed centre position with sufficient overlap and spring-centred central position. The position of 1V4 is monitored electrically, since 1V4 is not switched cyclically. • The software (SRASW) is programmed in accordance with the requirements for PL d and the information in sub- clause 6.3. • It is assumed that each output of the safety PLC is driven by both processing channels of the PLC. Should this not be the case, the outputs that drive 1V3 and 1V4 are driven by one channel of the PLC, the output that drives 1V5 by the other. Calculation of the probability of failure • Since the laser scanner F1 and the safety PLC K1 are available for purchase as safety components, their probabi- lities of failure are added at the end of the calculation (F1: PFH = 8.0 · 10-8 per hour
