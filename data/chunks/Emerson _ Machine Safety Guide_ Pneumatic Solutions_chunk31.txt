safety-related controls. Proper use has been tested and certified by the manufacturer. Further exemplary safety features: • Preventing a dangerous movement (Cat. 1 to max. PL c, “proven component”) • Secure hold in upper end position through clamping and one-sided pressurization (up to max. PL e) • Stopping a dangerous movement (emergency stop/ emergency off, up to max. PL e) The locking unit can be used in controls with a maximum performance level c or Cat. 1 according to ISO 13849-1 (“proven component”), e.g. to prevent a dangerous movement. When used in controls with a higher performance level, additional control measures according to ISO 13849-1 are necessary. On the next page you will find a circuit example that c Locking unit, Series LU6, max. holding force 12,000 NN allows different cylinder mounting positions. For the safety function “preventing a dangerous movement” the example control – provided that the cylinder locking unit is not used as a dynamic brake – achieves a maximum performance level e (PL e), according to ISO 13849-1. Other components must be provided to meet the requirements for diagnostics and redundancy, as well as prevent common cause failure. c Series Sensor IN1 Emerson expertise – AVENTICS-LU6| Machine safety 43 1A 2 1 Safety-related properties of the holding device • Permitted for use in category 3 controls up to max. performance level d in accordance with EN ISO 13849-1, for the safety function “preventing a dangerous movement” • For use in controls with a max. performance level c, category 1, as a “well-tried component” • High B dynamic braking values: 2 million cycles 10D • High B static holding values: 5 million cycles 10D • Components comply with basic and well-tried safety principles • Optional function query directly at LU6 by sensors, which directly monitor the pneumatic control
