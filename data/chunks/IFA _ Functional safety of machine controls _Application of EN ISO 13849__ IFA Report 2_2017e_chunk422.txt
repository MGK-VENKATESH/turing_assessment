For this reason, a rate of zero is sition exists to the “Operating inhibition” state shown on assigned to some transitions in Figure G.3.

For the purpose of sim- even though this holds true, strictly speaking, only for the plified calculation by means of the Markov method, it is constant-rate random failures. Separate considerations assumed that all transition processes are characterized by justify this simplification. Annex G It is assumed that at the beginning of the mission time, Annex K of the standard contains the content of Figure G.1 the probability of the system being in the OK state is 1 in numerical form in Table K.1. Table K.1 can be used to and the probability of all other possible system states is determine the Performance Level more precisely than 0. During the assumed mission time of 20 years, all state is possible by means of the figure; this is particularly probabilities gradually change: beginning at the OK state, useful when the PFH contributions of several cascaded D they are redistributed along the transition arrows. The subsystems require summation. Conversely, the bar chart
