the cross-section of the piston slide relative to the two main causes are: changes in cross-section inside the housing affect volume flow and are known as “control edges.” An essential feature of this • Contamination that occurs during assembly = assembly con- valve design worthy of note is what is known as the “lap.” The tamination (e.g., chips, mold sand, fibers from cloths, basic lap is the longitudinal distance between the stationary and mov- contamination) ing control edges of the slide valve. Due to the gap between the • Contamination that occurs during operation = operating piston and the housing bore required for hard-sealing valves, a contamination (e.g., ambient contamination, component leak will occur in the event of a pressure differential. abrasion) These contaminations must be reduced to an acceptable de- gree with the aid of filters. A filter concept refers to the suitable selection of a filter princi- ple for the task required as well as the arrangement of the filter in an appropriate location. The filter concept must be designed so that it is able to retain in the filter the contamination added to the entire system in such a way that the required purity is maintained throughout the operating time. - Proven safety principles: ISO 13849-2 (B-type standard) - Safety-related requirements on hydraulic/pneumatic systems: ISO 4413, ISO 4414 - Aging process on hydraulic valves: BIA report 6/2004 3-74 GUIDE FOR SAFE MACHINERY | SICK 7028282/2014-09-08 Subject to change without notice Risk reduction Safeguarding (technical protective measures) Safety-related pneumatics Electropneumatic control systems use a logic unit to imple- operating modes as element safety functions.
