objects, a gap(s) is created in the protective field. This/these must be closed by additional coverage (see figure 62). Alternatively, the detection capability resulting from the gap must be taken into account in the minimum distance calculation. NOTE In the blanked area, the resolution capability of ESPE is enlarged (deteriorates). Take the corresponding manufac‐ turer's specifications into account when calculating the minimum distance.
