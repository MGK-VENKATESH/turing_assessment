The advantage of this assumption is that subsequent mathematical analysis is considerably The assumption of an MTTF for each component of rele- D simplified as a result, and forms the basis for the Markov vance to safety (where reasons are not given for a fault modelling of the designated architectures upon which the exclusion) is a condition for the following steps, by which bar chart/the simplified method of EN ISO 13849-1 are the MTTF of each channel is produced, first at block and D based. A constant failure rate results mathematically in a then at channel level. At channel level, EN ISO 13849-1 reliability curve which falls exponentially over the mission proposes division into three typical MTTF classes (see D time, and in an anticipated value for the time to failure Table D.1). These classes are intended to cancel out minor (MTTF ) which corresponds to the reciprocal of the failure differences between the calculated MTTF values, which D D rate, i.e.: in any case become irrelevant
