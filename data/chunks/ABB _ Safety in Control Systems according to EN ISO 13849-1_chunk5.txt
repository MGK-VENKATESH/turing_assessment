reduced? No No Is the measure dependent on the Yes control system? Risk assessment and risk minimisation of exposure to the risk (F, frequency) and the possibility you have According to the Machinery Directive, the machine builder of avoiding or limiting the injury (P, possibility). For each factor two (anyone who builds or modifies a machine) is required to options are given. Where the boundary between the two options perform a risk assessment for the machine design and also lies is not specified in the standard, but the following are common include an assessment of all the work operations that need interpretations: to be performed. The EN ISO 12100 standard (combination of EN ISO 14121-1 and EN ISO 12100-1/-2) stipulates the S1 bruises, abrasions, puncture wounds and minor requirements for the risk assessment of a machine. It is crushing injuries this that EN ISO 13849-1 is based on, and a completed risk S2 skeletal injuries, amputations and death assessment is a prerequisite for being able to work with the F1 less frequently than every two weeks standard. F2 more often than every two weeks Step 1 – Risk assessment P1 slow machine movements, plenty of space, low A risk assessment begins with determining the scope of the power machine. This includes the space that the machine and its P2 quick machine movements, crowded, high power operators need for all of its intended applications, and all operational stages throughout the machine’s life cycle. By setting S, F and P for the risk, you will get the PL r All risk sources must then be identified for all work Performance Level (required) that is necessary for the risk operations throughout the machine’s life cycle. source. A risk estimation is made for each risk source, i.e. indication Finally, the risk assessment includes a
