This is to parts of control systems – Part 2: Validation (2012) ensure that a failure can be detected by a test before a demand of the safety function cannot be met (see also [3] ISO/TR 24119: Safety of machinery – Evaluation Annex G). of fault masking serial connection of interlocking devices associated with guards with potential free • The MTTF of the test channel (TE and OTE) must be contacts (11/15) D at least half as high as the MTTF of the functional D channel (I, L and O). This assumption ensures that the probability of failure of the test channel is not unac- ceptably high. Should this condition be violated (even after capping of the MTTF of the functional channel to D 100 years), it is
