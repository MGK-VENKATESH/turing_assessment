Errors in selection selection from further increasing the average probability of the operating mode may lead to the required safety of a dangerous failure per hour (PFH ) in each individual D functions not being activated: if a different operating safety function. mode is activated to that selected, other safety functions are activated rather than those required for the planned As stated in the introduction, an operating mode is cha- task.
