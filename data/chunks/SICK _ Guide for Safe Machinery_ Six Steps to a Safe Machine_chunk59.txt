They can be fixed or movable. Physical guards include, for example, covers, fences, barriers, flaps and protective doors. Covers and hoods prevent access from all sides. Fences are generally used to prevent full body access while barriers can only prevent unintentional or unconscious access to the hazardous points. The safety function is essential for the design of guards. Must, for example, the physical guard only prevent access, and/or also retain parts and radiation? Examples of ejected parts: • Breaking/bursting tools (grinding wheels, drills) • Emitted materials (dust, chips, slivers, particles) • Blown out materials (hydraulic oil, compressed air, lubricant, materials) • Parts ejected after the failure of a clamping or handling system Examples of radiation sources: • Thermal radiation from the process or the products (hot surfaces) • Optical radiation from lasers, IR or UV sources • Particle or ion radiation • Strong electromagnetic fields, high frequency equipment • High voltages from test systems or systems for
