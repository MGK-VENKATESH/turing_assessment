of safety requirements is something that ought to be taken into account as early as when purchasing a machine. How should machinery be purchased? The procurement process is crucial to the success of a project to build or modernize a production facility. The following points, for example, should be considered: • For complex assemblies of machines, designate a “site manager” in accordance with the Machinery Directive. • Clarify the procedure for the machinery or machine components provided in advance. • Draw up a contract specifying how additional documentation is to be provided (e.g., risk assessment, etc.) so that it will be easier to make changes downstream. • Define, as far as possible, the usage of important standards (harmonized standards in the EU) as the basis. • Agree on a procedure in the event of deviations from harmonized standards. Safety inspections Experience shows that in practice, machine safety is not perfect. Protective devices are often manipulated by the machine operator in order to work without hindrance. Other problems are the incorrect positioning of protective devices and improper integration into control systems. The safety state of work equipment and systems in operation is regulated by EU Directive 2009/104 / EC (“Work Equipment Directive”); it shall be inspected to ensure conformance with applicable national legislation. In particular, Article 4a of the Directive defines the inspection of work equipment. Technical rules, standards or certain regulations can serve as a guide as to how the inspection should be carried out. The user of the respective equipment must perform a risk assessment and is responsible for ensuring that the inspection is carried out and that occupational safety is ensured. In so doing, the user shall ensure that work equipment is inspected in accordance with the national transposition of the Work Equipment Directive to the country of
