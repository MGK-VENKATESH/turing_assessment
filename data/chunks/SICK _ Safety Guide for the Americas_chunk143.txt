essentially no difference between the main contact elements and the auxiliary contact elements. It is also possible to use the term “positively guided contacts” to refer to those small contactors. On larger contactors, what are known as “mirror contacts” are used: While any main contact on a contactor is closed, no mirror contact (auxiliary normally closed contact) is allowed to be closed. A typical application for mirror contacts is the highly reliable monitoring of the output state of a contactor in control circuits on machines. 3-70 GUIDE FOR SAFE MACHINERY | SICK 7028282/2014-09-08 Subject to change without notice GA relleoM :ecruoS Contact system of a contactor with positively guided contacts. A normally open contact is welded. Suppressor elements Inductances such as coils on valves or contactors must be an effect on the release delay and, therefore, on the required equipped with a suppressor to limit transient voltage spikes minimum distance of the protective device (g 3-44).

In this way, the switching element is protected diode for arc suppression can result in a time to respond against overload (in particular against overvoltage on particu- (switch to OFF) up to 14 times longer. This must be taken into larly sensitive semiconductors). As a rule, such circuits have account for when calculating the minimum safety distance.
