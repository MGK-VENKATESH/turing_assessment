systematic approach ensures that all aspects are considered, and that the overriding principle does not become lost in the detail. The whole process should be documented. Not only will this ensure a more thorough job, but it will also make the results available for checking by other parties. This section applies both to machine manufacturers and to machine users. The manufacturer needs to ensure that his machine is capable of being used safely. The risk assessment should be started at the machine design phase and it should take account of all the foreseeable tasks that will need to be performed on the machine. This task based approach at the early iterations of the risk assessment is very important. For example, there may be a regular need for adjustment of moving parts at the machine. At the design phase it should be possible to design in measures that will allow this process to be carried out safely. If it is missed at the early stage it may be diffi cult or impossible to implement at later stage. The result could be that the adjustment of moving parts still has to be performed but must be done in a manner that is either unsafe or ineffi cient (or both). A machine on which all tasks have been taken account of during the risk assessment will be a safer machine and a more effi cient machine. The user (or employer) needs to ensure that the machines in their working environment are safe. Even if a machine has been declared safe by the manufacturer, the machine user should still perform a risk assessment to determine whether the equipment is safe in their environment. Machines are often used in circumstances unforeseen by the manufacturer. For example, a milling machine used in a school workshop will
