microcontroller K4 receives a redundant message 2 from S1 via the bus transceiver K2. Within the response time/process safety time, K4 checks the correct displacement of the proportional valve 1V4, as signalled by the position measuring system 1S4 integrated into 1V4, for plausibility against the desired position determined from message 2. Should faults be detected, K4 switches off the hydraulic pressure at a higher level by means of the directional control valve 1V3, and places the system in the safe state. Design features • Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. Protective circuits (such as contact protection) as described in the initial paragraphs of Chapter 8 are implemented. • The MPC is a safety component suitable for use in PL d and satisfies the requirements for Category 3. • In accordance with the functional description, processing of the control information and actuation of the valves are effected within a Category 2 structure. Within this structure, K4 and 1S4 form the test channel with 1V3 as the shut- off element of the test channel. • Owing to the continual monitoring of 1V4 by K4 through 1S4, failure of 1V4 can be detected as soon as a demand is made upon the safety function. 1V3 must execute the safe response within the response time in order for the struc- ture of the control to satisfy Category 2. Abrupt switching of 1V3 at a higher level must not give rise to hazards. • The proportional valve 1V4 and the directional control valve 1V3 have a closed position/closed centre position, spring centred central position, and sufficient overlap. • The software (SRESW) for K3 and K4 is programmed in accordance with the requirements for PL d and the informa- tion in subclause 6.3. 153 8 Circuit examples
