enabling switch principle (see "Enabling devices", page 86) • With manual reset on actuation of the actuator beyond the pressure point • In such a way that after the dangerous machine function has stopped, the restart occurs only after the foot switch is released and actuated again 86 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION • In such a way that a short circuit in the connection cable between the foot switch and the control system does not trigger an unintentional start (e.g., with at least one normally open contact and one normally closed contact for evaluation) • In appropriate numbers for all operators, so that a dangerous machine function can only be initiated and maintained if all foot switches are actuated Sensors for monitoring machine parameters The risk assessment may show that certain machine parameters shall be monitored and detected during opera‐ tion (see "Monitoring machine parameters", page 47). Safe position monitoring If, for safety reasons, parts of a machine are not allowed to overrun or leave a certain position, position switches or safety-related sensors should be used for this purpose. Electro-sensitive safety inductive position switches are particularly suitable for this task (see table 21, page 63). They monitor a certain part of a robot’s axis or a moving part of a machine for presence without the need for a specific actuator, without wear, and with a high enclosure rating. Figure 70: Safe position monitoring for a lift on an automobile production line Monitoring of rotation, speed, overrun Encoders or travel measurement systems are used to detect and evaluate rotation, speed, and overrun. The signals from encoders can be used in automated guided vehicles to adapt the protective field size of safety laser scanners to
