Machine users expect to be offered only safe machinery or devices. This expectation exists worldwide. There are also regulations on the protection of operators of machinery worldwide. These regulations are subject to regional variations. However, there is broad agreement on the process to be applied during the manufacture and upgrade of machinery. • During the design and manufacture of machinery, the machine manufacturer shall identify and evaluate all possible hazards and hazardous points by under- taking a risk assessment (formerly also called a hazard analysis). • Based on this risk assessment, the supplier and user should take suitable design measures to eliminate or reduce the risk. If the risk cannot be eliminated by these design measures or the remaining risk cannot be tolerated, the supplier and user shall define, select, and apply suitable engineering controls. If the remain- ing risk is not acceptable, administrative controls such as organizational proce- dures should be implemented. Information on the residual risks should also be provided. • To ensure the intended measures work correctly, overall validation is necessary. This overall validation shall evaluate the design and technical measures, as well as the organizational measures in context. We can guide you to safe machinery in 6 steps. The procedure is outlined on the previous page. About this guide What does the guide contain? Who is this guide for? In front of
