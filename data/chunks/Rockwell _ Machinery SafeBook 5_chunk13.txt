FOR SAFETY COMPONENTS—You must issue a Declaration of Conformity. Whereas the Machinery Directive is aimed at suppliers, this Directive (2009/104/EC) is aimed at users of machinery. It covers all industrial sectors and it places general duties on employers together with minimum requirements for the safety of work equipment. All EU countries are enacting their own forms of legislation to implement this Directive. 11 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery For example it is implemented in the UK under the name of The Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations (often abbreviated to P.U.W.E.R.). The form of implementation may vary between countries but the effect of the Directive is retained. The articles of the Directive give details of which types of equipment and workplaces are covered by the Directive. They also place general duties on employers such as instituting safe systems of working and providing suitable and safe equipment that must be properly maintained. Machine operators must be given proper information and training for the safe use of the machine. New machinery (and second hand machinery from outside the EU) provided after January 1, 1993 should satisfy any relevant product directives, e.g., The Machinery Directive (subject to transitional arrangements). Second hand equipment from within the EU provided for the fi rst time in the workplace must immediately provide minimum requirements given in an annex of the U.W.E. Directive. Note: Existing or second-hand machinery which is signifi cantly overhauled or modifi ed will be classifi ed as new equipment, so the work carried out on it must ensure compliance with the Machinery Directive (even if it is for a company’s own use). Suitability of work equipment is an important requirement of the directive and it highlights the employer’s responsibility to carry out a proper process of risk assessment. It
