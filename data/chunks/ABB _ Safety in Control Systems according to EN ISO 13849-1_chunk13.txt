ISO 13849-1 Safety in control systems according to EN ISO 13849-1 | 9 * S1 S2 Emerg. Stop Emerg. Stop K1 Q1 RT9 Contactors Q2 Contactors B2 B1 Key switch Key switch * Monitoring of contactors with K1 Step 3 - Calculate the safety functions How safe is a mechanical switch? The starting block that is composed of double unmonitored A mechanical switch must be installed and used according contactors has been calculated at 2.47·10-8. The safety to its specifications in order to be reliable. functions are represented by block diagrams. • Life expectancy only applies if correctly installed. Safety functions 1 and 2 are identical. Therefore, only safety • The locking head must be fixed so that it will not loosen. function 1 is shown. • The environment around the lock housing must be kept clean. Safety functions 3 and 4 are identical. Therefore, only safety • Two mechanical switches on a door can also fail for the function 3 is shown. same reason. Safety function 1 Input Logic Output Result B1 Q1/Q2 K1 PL=c Key switch Redundant monitored PL c r Safety relay RT9 JSNY8 contactors PL e PL c PL e PFH + PFH + PFH = 1,14·10-6 + 9,55 ·10-9+ 2,47·10-8 = 1,17·10-6 PL c D, JSNY8 D, RT9 D, Q1/Q2 Safety function 3 Input Logic Output Result S1 K1 Q1/Q2 PL=c E-Stop button Safety relay RT9 Redundant monitored PL c r PL c PL e contactors PL e PFH + PFH + PFH = 1,34·10-6 + 9,55 ·10-9 + 2,47·10-8 = 1,37·10-6 PL c D D, RT9 D, Q1/Q2 The reason for not achieving more than PL c with this solution is that you use one key switch per door. PL d could be achieved by using two key switches per door, but further action
