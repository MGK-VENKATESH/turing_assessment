your protective device. Do you need, for example, one or more electro-sensitive protective devices (ESPE), guards, movable guards or fixed position protective devices? • Determine the correct positioning and dimensions for each protective device, in particular the safety distance (minimum distance) and the necessary protective field size/height for the protective device concerned. • Integrate the protective devices as stated in the instruction handbook and as necessary for the level of safety. Logic units • Choose the correct logic unit based on the number of safety functions and the logic depth. • Use certified function blocks and keep your design clear. • Have the design and the documentation thoroughly checked (principle of counter checking by a second person). 3 c - All SICK products are listed in our online product finder at http://www.sickusa.com/ 7028282/2014-09-08 GUIDE FOR SAFE MACHINERY | SICK 3-77 Subject to change without notice Safeguarding (technical protective measures) Risk reduction § 1 2 3 c 3-78 GUIDE FOR SAFE MACHINERY | SICK 7028282/2014-09-08 Subject to change without notice Risk reduction Technical protective measures Risk reduction Technical protective measures Step 3d: Verification of the safety function During verification, analyses and/or Essentially, verification involves two checks are carried out to demonstrate stages: that all aspects of the safety function • Verification of mechanical execution meets the objectives and requirements • Verification of functional safety of the specification.
