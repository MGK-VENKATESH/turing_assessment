a lying person A test body with a diameter of 200 mm and a length of 600 mm must be used. The test body is placed horizontally in a fixed position on the left, in the middle, and on the right of the vehicle path to be protected and orthogonal (perpendicular) to the vehicle path. Figure 81: Positioning of a test body on an autonomous vehi‐ cle for testing the detection of a person lying down 2. For detecting a standing person A test body with a diameter of 70 mm and a length of 400 mm must be used. The test body is placed vertically and completely in a fixed position anywhere on the vehicle path to be protected.

Validation The vehicle must be loaded with the nominal load and approach the test body at the maximum operating speed. The vehicle must stop in time, therefore either not touch the test body or, if contact occurs, the force applied to the (1) horizontal test body must not exceed 750 N and to the (2) vertical test body must not exceed 250 N. This is the current standardized method to be used for the protection of autonomous vehicles in the industrial sector (ISO 3691-4). The method can also be used for the non-industrial sector, but it is important to consider the following: • It cannot always be assumed that persons will never approach the moving vehicle. Both speeds (person and vehicle) may therefore need to be considered accordingly. • The maximum permissible forces in the event of
