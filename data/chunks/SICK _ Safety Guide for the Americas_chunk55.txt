economic damage. Where dust, inflammable gases, or liquids are manufactured, transported, processed, or stored, a potentially explosive atmo- sphere may be produced, i.e., a mixture of fuel and atmospher- ic oxygen within the limits for explosions. If a source of ignition is present, an explosion will occur. 2 Assessing the scope of the protective measures necessary For an assessment of the protective measures necessary, The information in the following table does not apply in the field potentially explosive atmospheres are categorized in “zones” of mining (open-cast, underground). based on the probability of the occurrence of a hazardous potentially explosive atmosphere, see Directive 1992/92/EC, Annex I. Zone definition For gases G Zone 2 Zone 1 Zone 0 For dust D Zone 22 Zone 21 Zone 20 Potentially explosive atmosphere Seldom, short duration Occasional Continuous, frequent, long (< 10/year) (10 -- 100 h/year) duration (> 1,000 h/year) Safety measure Normal High Very high Device category that can be used (ATEX) 1 II 1G/II 1D 2 II 2G/II 2D 3 II 3G/II 3D Marking Equipment must be designed, tested, and marked accordingly for use in these zones II 2G EEx ia IIC T4 Example: Marking of an item of equipment as per ATEX Temperature class Can be used at ignition temperature > 135 °C Explosion group Acetylene, carbon disulfide, hydrogen Protection principle i = intrinsically safe a = two-fault safe Device category (ATEX) Can be used in zone 1 Device group Not for use in areas where there is a risk of firedamp Explosion protection marking - Directive 1994/9/EC (ATEX 95 – manufacturer) ATEX standard EN 1127-1 7028282/2014-09-08 GUIDE FOR SAFE MACHINERY | SICK 2-15 Subject to change without notice Safe design Risk reduction Summary: Safe design Mechanics, electronics, operation • Keep to the principle of not allowing hazards to occur in the
