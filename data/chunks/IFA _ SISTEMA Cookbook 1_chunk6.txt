must be applied. In Categories 1, 2, 3 and 4, safety principles which are well-tried must also be applied. Information on these aspects can be found in EN ISO 13849-2. Quantitative requirements the observance of which is checked by SISTEMA also apply to the Categories. The procedure described here is geared to the application of EN ISO 13849-1 and its "desig- nated architectures" for the Categories. If modelling to one of the categories is not possible, even when additional components or channels are omitted, the simplified method described in the standard cannot be applied. In this case, the probability of failure must be verified with recourse to other methods, such as Markov modelling, as described in EN 61508-6, Annex B. SISTEMA Cookbook (Version 1.0) - 10 - 3 From the schematic circuit diagram to the safety-related block diagram Procedure for structural analysis: The starting-point for the structural analysis is the schematic circuit diagram on which the function and test channels are marked. The procedure is shown schematically in Annex E. Figure 5 contains the same procedure, together with its application to Examples 1 and 2 shown in Chapter 2. Step 1: Formation of a sequence of the components in a functional channel All components along the first functional channel (that with the fewest components) are writ- ten as blocks from left to right (from the sensor to the actuator). Step 2: Considering the first block Each individual block of the first functional channel is now assigned in turn to subsystems of the relevant Category, according to the characteristic features of the Categories. Step 3: Does the component manufacturer state the PL and PFH (and Category)? An encapsulated subsystem can be recognized as such by the fact that it is already charac- terized by the manufacturer by a PL (or SIL
