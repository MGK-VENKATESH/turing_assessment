the NFPA70 standard mandatory. The 29 CFR 1910.147, in Subpart J, covers the control of hazardous energy. This is commonly known as the Lockout/Tagout standard. The equivalent voluntary standard is ANSI Z244.1. Essentially, this standard requires power to the machine to be locked out when undergoing service or maintenance. The purpose is to prevent the unexpected energization or startup of the machine which would result in injury to employees. Employers must establish a lockout and tagout program and utilize procedures for affi xing appropriate lockout devices or tagout devices to energy isolating devices, and to otherwise disable machines or equipment to prevent unexpected energization, start up or release of stored energy in order to prevent injury to employees. Minor tool changes and adjustments, and other minor servicing activities, which take place during normal production operations, are covered by ANSI Z244 “Alternative Measures” if they are routine, repetitive, and integral to the use of the equipment for production, provided that the work is performed using alternative measures which provide effective protection. This is directly supported by OSHA in the “OSHA Minor Servicing Exception”. Alternative measures are safeguarding devices like light curtains, safety mats, gate interlocks and other similar devices connected to a safety system. The challenge to the machine designer and user is to determine what is “minor” and what is “routine, repetitive and integral.” This can be covered during the Risk Assessment. Subpart O covers “Machinery and Machine Guarding.” This subpart lists the general requirements for all machines as well as requirements for some specifi c machines. When OSHA was formed in 1971, it adopted many existing ANSI standards. For example B11.1 for mechanical power presses was adopted as 1910.217. The 1910.212 is the general OSHA standard for machines. It states that one or more methods of machine guarding shall
