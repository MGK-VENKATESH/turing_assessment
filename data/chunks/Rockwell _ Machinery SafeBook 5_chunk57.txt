restart can only be achieved by closing the guard and then switching “ON” at the normal start button which resets the contactor and starts the machine. The requirement for normal interlocking situations is made clear in ISO 12100 (extract): “When the guard is closed, the hazardous machine functions covered by the guard can operate, but the closure of the guard does not by itself initiate their operation”. Many machines already have either single or double contactors which operate as described above (or have a system which achieves the same result). When fi tting an interlock to existing machinery it is necessary to determine whether the power control arrangement meets this requirement and take additional measures if necessary. Reset Functions Allen Bradley Guardmaster monitoring safety relays are designed with either monitored manual reset or automatic/manual reset. Monitored Manual Reset A monitored manual reset requires a change of state of the reset circuit after the gate is closed or the emergency stop is reset. The mechanically linked normally closed auxiliary contacts of the power switching contactors are connected in series with a momentary push button. After the guard has been opened and closed again, the safety relay will not allow the machine to be restarted until there is a change of 47 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery state at the reset button. This is in compliance with the intent of the requirements for additional manual reset as given in (EN) ISO 13849-1. i.e., the reset function ensures that both contactors are OFF and that both interlock circuits (and therefore the guards) are closed and also (because a change of state is required) that the reset actuator has not been bypassed or blocked (tied down) in any way. If these checks are successful the machine can then be restarted
