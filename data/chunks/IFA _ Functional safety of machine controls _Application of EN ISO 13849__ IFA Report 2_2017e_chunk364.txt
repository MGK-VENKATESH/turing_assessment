failure mode of components varies ration as a “safety-related part of the control system”; strongly according to the technology employed, since valves that control hazardous movements or states, in the “bath-tub characteristic” and the relevance of wear particular, are extremely important for calculation of 267 Annex D the Performance Level. Experience has shown that the possible to calculate an MTTF for each individual year. D failure behaviour of hydraulic valves is characterized The MTTF rose, from 195 years in 2000 to 300 in 2003. D less by random failures than by failures due to wear. The A significant relationship was observed between valve causes of such failures are primarily systematic, such failures and operating/environmental conditions, since as excessive stress, unfavourable conditions of use, or the maintenance measures and operating conditions in lack of maintenance. In order for the lifetime of hydraulic User B's facility had been improved continually over the valves to be estimated better, the IFA (at that time still years. In addition, the operating conditions were superior the BGIA) launched a degree thesis on the subject, the to those in User A's plant owing to further measures, such results of which are available in the form of BIA-Report as monitoring of the fluid temperature; larger fluid reser- 6/2004, “Untersuchung des Alterungsprozesses von voirs, generally located outside the machine; finer return hydraulischen Wegeventilen” [3] (study of the ageing line filters; and flue gas discharge systems for reducing process of hydraulic directional control valves). Since the impurities in the ambient atmosphere. The study valves that assume control tasks are generally piston-type showed that, in conjunction with the type, quality, and directional control valves, the MTTF values for “hydraulic level of contamination of the hydraulic fluid used and the D components” were determined on valves of this type. The design, material
