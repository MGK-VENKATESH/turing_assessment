Machinery Directive. Manufacturers shall take account of the safety integration already during the design phase. In practice, this means that the designer shall perform a risk assessment already at the design phase of the machine. The resulting measures shall be incorporated directly into development. Steps 1 to 5 of this guide describe in detail how to proceed here. Preparing technical documents The machine manufacturer shall prepare a technical files according to Annex VII of the Machinery Directive. The technical files are subject to the following criteria: 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 13 Subject to change without notice § – LAWS, DIRECTIVES, STANDARDS • It shall contain all diagrams, calculations, test reports and documents that are relevant to the conformity with the essential health and safety requirements of the Machinery Directive. • It shall be archived for at least ten years from the last day of manufacture of the machine (or the machine type). • Shall be submitted to the authorities on duly reasoned request. NOTE It is not possible to derive from the Machinery Directive an obligation on the manufacturer to supply the complete technical documentation to the purchaser (user) of the machine. Issuing the declaration of conformity After the machine manufacturer has built his machine according to the requirements of the Machinery Directive, he shall declare, in a legally binding manner, conformity with these requirements by issuing a declaration of conformity and marking the machine (CE marking). It is then permitted to place the machine on the market in the European Union. The Machinery Directive explains the process for the conformity assessment. There are two procedures for machinery (see "EU conformity assessment procedure for machinery and safety components", page 16): • Standard procedure: Machines that are not explicitly listed in Annex IV of the
