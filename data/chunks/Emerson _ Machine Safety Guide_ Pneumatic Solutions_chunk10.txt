The function of 1A the 1V1 valve and the 2A locking unit is monitored by the 1S1 distance measuring sensor. 2 2 1Z1 1Z2 1 1 4 2 2 5 1 3 1 3 1V1 2V 16 Machine safety | Basic conditions Safety principles Basic and well-tried safety principles (line 1 in the table on page 16 or poster) take precedence, i.e. critical errors or failures must be excluded to reduce the probability of failure. Basic safety principles include: Well-tried safety principles include: • Use of suitable materials and production • Overdimensioning/safety factor processes • Automatic/form-fit actuation • Correct dimensioning and forming of • Limited electrical/mechanical parameters in all components fluid technology: • Highly resistant components (against various - Secured position (excluding impulse valves) influences) - Use of well-tried springs • Energy isolation (quiescent current principle) - Separation of safety functions from non-safety • Ambient conditions/external protection against functions unexpected startup in fluid technology: - Pressure limitation - Measures to prevent contamination of pressure medium Well-tried components: In addition to the category B requirements, safety-related parts of control systems in category 1 must also be constructed as well-tried components.
