Hazardous movements are controlled by two directional control valves (1V3 and 1V4). • Failure of one of the two valves alone does not result in loss of the safety function. • The two directional control valves are actuated cyclically. • Each directional control valve is equipped with a direct position monitor (1S3 and 1S4). Failure of either of the two directional control valves is detected; following a fault, initiation of the next hazardous movement is prevented. 218 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS 1V3 1V4 1S3 1S4 Design features • Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. • Directional control valves 1V3 and 1V4 possess a closed centre position with sufficient overlap, spring-centred central position/return, and electrical position monitoring. • The safety-oriented switching position is assumed from any position by cancellation of the control signal. • Signal processing by the electrical position monitoring function satisfies the relevant requirements for the control of failures. Calculation of the probability of failure • MTTF : an MTTF of 150 years is assumed for the directional control valves 1V3 and 1V4 [M]. D D • DC : the DC of 99% for the directional control valves 1V3 and 1V4 is based upon direct monitoring of the switching avg states. Averaging thus produces a DC also of 99% (“high”). avg • Adequate measures against common cause failure (65 points): separation (15), overvoltage protection etc. (15) and environmental conditions (25 + 10) • The combination of the hydraulic control elements satisfies Category 4 with a high MTTF and high DC (99%). D avg This results in an average probability of dangerous failure of 1.6 · 10-8 per hour. This satisfies PL e. Following the addition of further SRP/CS in the form of subsystems for completion of the safety function,
