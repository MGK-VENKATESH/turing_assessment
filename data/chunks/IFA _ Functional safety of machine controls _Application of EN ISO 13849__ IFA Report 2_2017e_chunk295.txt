not exceed one-hundredth of the MTTF of Q1; the test could be performed for D example during maintenance of the machine. The contactor Q2 is tested continually by the contactor monitoring module. Loss of the safety function between the tests, as is possible with Category 2, cannot occur. The single-fault safety is thus assured and the requirements of Category 3 are met. • Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. Protective circuits (such as contact protection) as described in the initial paragraphs of Chapter 8 are implemented. • For reasons of simplification, details of the safeguard have been omitted from the presentation. • The safeguard acts upon a safety module K1 that satisfies all requirements for Category 3 or 4 and PL e. • The auxiliary contacts of the contactor Q2 are mechanically linked in accordance with IEC 60947-5-1, Annex L. • Faults are analysed for Q2 (with mirror contacts) and for the internal relay of the contactor monitoring module F1 as for mechanically linked contacts. Remark • Consideration must be given to the response time caused by the contactor monitoring module F1 with regard to the dropping-out of Q1. Calculation of the probability of failure • The safety function permits division into two subsystems. The subsystem consisting of the safeguard and the safety module K1 is not considered in this example. • MTTF : for the contactor monitoring module F1, the MTTF is 125 years at a maximum n of 350,400 cycles per D D op year [M]. Under inductive load (AC 3), the B value attained for Q1 is 10,000 switching cycles and the B value 10D 10D attained for Q2 1,300,000 switching cycles. With assumed actuation daily on 365 working days, n is 365 cycles op per year for
