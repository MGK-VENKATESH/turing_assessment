determined by applying the detailed In practice, certified subsystems are already used in many ponent manufacturer. These values apply only for the mission cases for certain safety functions. These subsystems can be time to be specified by the manufacturer. In addition to the light curtains, for example, but also safety controllers, for which quantifiable aspects, it is also necessary to verify the measures "pre-calculated" PL or PFHd values are supplied by the com- against systematic failures. - More information about validation: ISO 13849-2 - Go to http://www.dguv.de/ifa/Praxishilfen/Maschinensteuerungen/index.jsp for comprehensive information about ISO 13849-1 7028282/2014-09-08 GUIDE FOR SAFE MACHINERY | SICK 3-81 Subject to change without notice Technical protective measures Risk reduction Simplified method This method allows the overall PL for many applications to be This method is based on mean values within the PFHd range of estimated with sufficient accuracy without knowing individual values for the various PL. Therefore, using the detailed method PFHd values. If the PL of all subsystems is known, the overall (see next section) may deliver more accurate results. PL achieved by a safety function can be determined using the following table. Procedure PL (low) n (low) PL • Calculate the PL of the subsystem or subsystems with the (lowest PL of a sub- (number of subsys- (maximum 1 lowest PL in a safety function: PL (low) system) tems with this PL) achievable PL) 1 • Determine the number of subsystems with this PL (low): > 3 – a n (low) ≤ 3 a Example 1: > 2 a b • All subsystems achieve a PL of e, the PL (low) is, therefore, ≤ 2 b e. > 2 b • The number of subsystems with this PL is 3 (i.e., ≤3). There- c ≤ 2 c fore, the overall PL achieved is e. > 3
