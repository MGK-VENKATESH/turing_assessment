on the monitoring of each switch will be required as well. Note: If the risk assessment had shown that a serious injury, S2, could occur, the outcome would have been PL= e. r This would have meant that the above solution was inadequate. For the emergency stop function, PL d can be achieved provided that certain failure exclusions can be made. These safety functions can be downloaded from our website as a SISTEMA project, www.jokabsafety.com. Example 2 Safety system using Vital Protection layout for a robot cell with high risks. Non-contact sensor, Eden Monitors that the door is Safety controller, Vital closed. Monitors safety components in series. Emergency stop button, Smile Tina To stop the machine in case of danger. Emergency stop button INCA Tina Light curtain, Focus (with To stop the machine in integrated muting function) case of danger. Prevents passage. Step 1 â€“ Risk assessment The workpieces are fed into the equipment and transported is required. The power source to all hazardous machinery out again following an error-free test. With the help of a functions has to be cut using all safety functions. robot the workpieces are added to a machine for testing. The solution with Vital makes it possible to implement a Unauthorised workpieces are positioned by the robot for robot application with only one safety controller, which does post-machining in a manual discharge station. The work that not need to be configured or programmed. Vital makes it needs to be done in the robot cell is to correct operational possible to connect up to 30 safety functions in a single loop, disturbances for the test equipment and the conveyor belt with PL e in accordance with EN ISO 13849-1. (about once an hour), post-machining and unloading from the manual station (about once an hour), program adjustments
