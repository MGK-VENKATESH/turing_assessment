great. • The logic unit K1 satisfies Type III C to EN 574, with self-monitoring and detection of internal faults. K1 is a tested safety component for use in Category 4 and PL e. • The contactor relays K2 and K3 possess mechanically linked break contacts in accordance with IEC 60947-5-1, Annex L for feedback. Remarks • The example shown is suitable for application for example on mechanical presses (EN 692). Calculation of the probability of failure • K1 is considered as a subsystem with a probability of failure of 3.0 · 10-9 per hour [M]. The remaining part of the control system is grouped to form a Category 4 subsystem the probability of failure of which is calculated below. • Since S1 and S2 must initiate de-energization independently of each other when released, they are connected logically in series. For this purpose, one make contact 13-14 and one break contact 21-22 were each assigned to a control channel. The safety-related block diagram differs substantially in this respect from the functional circuit diagram. If the reliability data are available only for the pushbuttons as a whole (actuation mechanism and break and make contacts), the failure values for the pushbuttons may be employed as an estimation erring on the safe side for the failure values for the contacts (plus operating mechanism). • MTTF : owing to the defined control current generated by K1 (low electrical load; the mechanical durability of the D contacts is the determining factor), B values of 2,000,000 switching cycles [M] are assumed in each case for 10D S1 and S2. At 240 working days, 8 working hours and a cycle time of 30 seconds, n is 230,400 cycles per year op for these components, and the MTTF is 86.8 years per contact. Since K2 and K3 also
