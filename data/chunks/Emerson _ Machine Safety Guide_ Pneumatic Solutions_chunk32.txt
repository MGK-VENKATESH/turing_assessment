Here, analog distance measuring sensors not only provide diagnostics, but also measure the position of the pneumatic cylinder piston with great accuracy and ease. Thanks to simple mounting in the slot from above, flexible settings within the maximum distance measurement range and an extremely high proximity switching rate, the SM6 sensor is ideal for demanding automation solutions. Sensor Series SM6 Your advantages: *From 4 bar: release 2V1 • Suitable for 6 mm T-slot • Zero point and measurement range settings via teach-in button • Choice of any mounting position and cable exit • Mounting from above in the slot (“drop-in”) • High accuracy and linearity • Excellent repeatability and reliability through proven Hall sensors
