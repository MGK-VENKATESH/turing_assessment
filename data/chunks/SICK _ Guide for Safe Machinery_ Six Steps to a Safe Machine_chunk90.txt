the speed at which the vehi‐ cles are moving. Safe standstill or rotation evaluation modules monitor the movement of drives using sensors or rotary encod‐ ers to generate a safe control signal at standstill or on deviation from preset parameters. If safety-related requirements are more stringent, either safety encod‐ ers or redundant encoders shall be used. Another possibility is to monitor the voltage induced by residual magnetism on a motor that is spinning down.

The principle of operation is based in the majority of cases on the elastic deformation of a hollow body that ensures an internal signal generation (electromechanical or optical) which triggers the safety function. The standard electromechanical systems are available in various designs. Correct mechanical layout and integration is imperative in all cases for an effective protective function. The detec‐ tion of children with body weights less than 20 kg is not considered in the product standards for pressure-sensitive mats and floors.

This design is more universal and offers In the case of the 4-wire version, a circuit is short-circuited (a few ohms). In the more advantages. As on a safety switch, case of the resistance version, a change from
