microprocessors, the beams can be evaluated individually. This enables additional ESPE functions to be implemented in addition to the pro‐ tective function itself ("Additional functions of ESPE", page 81). Figure 45: Hazardous point protection using a safety light curtain Safety laser scanners (AOPDDR) AOPDDRs are protective devices that use optoelectronic sender and receiver elements to detect the reflection of optical radiation generated by the protective device. This reflection is generated by an object in a predefined two-dimensional area. Detection is signaled by a signal change (OFF state) to its output signal switching devices (OSSDs). These signals from the OSSDs are used to stop the dangerous machine functions. A safety laser scanner is an optical sensor which monitors a hazardous area on a machine or vehicle by scanning the area around it on a single plane with infrared light beams. The safety laser scanner operates on the principle of optical time-of-flight measurement. The scanner sends very short light pulses (S) while an “electronic stop‐ watch” runs simultaneously. If the light strikes an object, it is reflected and received by the scanner (R). The scanner calculates the distance from the object from the difference between the send and receive times. A uniformly rotating mirror (M) in the scanner deflects the light pulses such that a sector of a circle is covered. Person The scanner then determines the exact position of the object from the measured distance and the angle of rotation of the mirror.
