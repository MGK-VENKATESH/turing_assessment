descriptively termed “stupid redundancy”] to a redundant system where all single faults are detected. This issue is addressed in (EN) ISO 13849-1 by the requirement to estimate the quality of the Diagnostic Coverage [DC]. We can see that the greater the reliability [MTTF ] of the system, the less the DC we need. However, in all D cases, DC needs to be at least 60% for Category 3 Architecture. Wiring Wiring Input Logic Output Device Device Monitoring Cross Monitoring Wiring Wiring Input Logic Output Device Device Monitoring Designated Architecture Category 4 Designated Architecture Category 4 must use basic safety principles [see annexes of (EN) ISO 13849-2]. It has a similar requirements diagram to Category 3 but it 75 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery demands greater monitoring i.e. higher Diagnostic Coverage. This is shown by the heavier dotted lines representing the monitoring functions. In essence the difference between Categories 3 and 4 is that for Category 3 most faults must be detected but for Category 4 all single dangerous faults and dangerous combinations of faults must be detected. In practice this is usually achieved by having a high level of diagnostics to ensure that all relevant faults are detected before any accumulation is possible. The DC needs to be at least 99%. Reliability Data (EN) ISO 13849-1 uses quantitative reliability data as part of the calculation of the PL achieved by the safety related parts of a control system. The fi rst question this raises is “where do we get this data from?” It is possible to use data from recognised reliability handbooks but the standard makes it clear that the preferred source is the manufacturer. To this end, Rockwell Automation has made the relevant information available in the form of a data library for SISTEMA. Before
