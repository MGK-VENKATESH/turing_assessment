existing documentation concerning identified hazards and risk assessment for the machine 3.2 Results of the risk assessment for each identified hazard or hazardous situation and determination of the safety function(s) required in each case for risk reduction 4 Safety functions (information applies to each safety function; see also Table 4 in [23]) – Description of the function (“input – logic – output“) including all functional characteristics (refer also to Tables 5.1 and 5.2) – Activation/deactivation conditions or events (e.g. operating modes of the machine) – Behaviour of the machine when the safety function is triggered – Conditions to be observed for re-starting – Performance criteria/performance data – Process (timing behaviour) of the safety function, including response time – Frequency of actuation (i.e. demand rate), recovery time following demand – Other data – Adjustable parameters (where implemented) – Classification and assignment of priorities in the event of simultaneous demand upon and processing of multiple safety functions – Behaviour in the event of a power failure – Functional concept for separation or independence/freedom of reciprocal action from non-safety functions and further safety functions 5 Required information for the SRP/CS design 5.1 Allocation of the SRP/CS and the form of technology by which the safety function is to be implemented; intended equipment 5.2 Selection of the Category, designated architecture (structure) in the form of a safety-related block diagram and description 5.3 Description of the interfaces (process interfaces, internal interfaces, user interfaces, control and display elements, etc.) 5.4 Behaviour at switch-on, implementation of the required starting and restarting behaviour 5.5 Performance data: cycle times, response times, etc. 43 6 Design of safe control systems 5.6 Behaviour of the SRP/CS in the event of component failures and faults (achieving and maintenance of the safe state), including timing behaviour 5.7 Failure modes of components, modules or
