Validation shall show that safety-related parts of the control function meet the requirements of ISO 13849-2, in particular the requirements for the level of safety defined. Insofar as is reasonable, validation should be carried out by persons who were not involved in the design of the safety-related parts of the control systems. In the validation process, it is important to check errors and in particular omissions in the formulated specification. The critical part of how a safety-related control function has been designed is usually the specification. For example, access to a robot cell is to be safeguarded by a light curtain. The safety function is thus specified as follows: “If the protective field of a light curtain is interrupted, all hazardous machine functions shall cease as quickly as possible.” However, the designer shall also have considered restarting when the protective field becomes clear again, in particular if access can be gained to it by standing behind this field. The validation process shall uncover such aspects. As a rule, a validation process involves the application of a number of procedures that complement each other.
