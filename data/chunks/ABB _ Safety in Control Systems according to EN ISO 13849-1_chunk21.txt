Machine 1 B1 K1 Q2 Interlocked switch Logic unit Machine 2 S1 Q3 E-Stop button Machine 3 14 | Safety in control systems according to EN ISO 13849-1 Theoretical approach for multiple machines Practical approach for multiple machines The theoretical approach to calculate the safety function is as A more practical approach is to divide the safety function into follows: three parts, one for each of the three machines. This is an approach that can provide a more accurate way of B1 K1 Q1 Q2 Q3 Interlocked Logic Machine Machine Machine B1 K1 Q1 switch unit 1 2 3 Interlocked switch Logic unit Machine 1 For the full safety function to be performed you require all B1 K1 Q2 the components to be working. Note that if B1 or K1 has a Interlocked switch Logic unit Machine 2 dangerous malfunction, the entire safety function is disabled. B1 K1 Q3 However, if for example machine Q1 has a dangerous Interlocked switch Logic unit Machine 3 malfunction, and is not shut down, machines Q2 and Q3 will still be shut down. One disadvantage in considering looking at the safety functions, especially where a different the safety function in this way is that you may have trouble PL is required for the safety functions above. If machine Q1 r achieving the PL r required. But if you achieve the PL r is a robot and machine Q2 is a conveyor which is designed required, you can use the theoretical approach. to have negligible risks, the different PL required to protect r against risks from Q1 and Q2 will also be different. This practical approach is therefore the one recommended.
