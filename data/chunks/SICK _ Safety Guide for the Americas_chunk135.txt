designed so that Hazardous point protection without reset it withstands the foreseeable load and the intended effect can only be obtained by intentional actuation ( touch panels are unsuitable). According to ISO 13849-1 (Subclause 5.2.2), the reset shall only be generated by releasing the command device from its actuated (On) position. For this reason, signal process- ing is required to detect the falling edge of the signal from the 2 command device. Reset is only permitted if all safety functions and protective devices are functional. The command device for the reset shall be installed outside the hazard zone such that it is not accessible from within the safeguarded area. It shall be possible from this position to 3 completely oversee the hazard zone. By this means it can be checked that there is nobody in the hazard zone. c In this arrangement it is not possible to remain in the hazard zone without being detected. Therefore, a separate reset of the protective device is not necessary. The position of the reset pushbutton allows a full view of the hazard zone for the resetting of the protective device. 3-64 GUIDE FOR SAFE MACHINERY | SICK 7028282/2014-09-08 Subject to change without notice Risk reduction Safeguarding (technical protective measures) Integration of protective devices into the control system Along with mechanical aspects, a protective device must also be integrated into the control system. "Control systems are functional assemblies that form part of the information system of a machine and implement logical func- tions. They coordinate the flows of material and energy to the area of action of the tool and workpiece system in the context of a task. […] control systems differ in terms of the technology used, i.e., the information carriers, fluid, electrical and electronic control systems." Translation of text from: Alfred Neudörfer:
