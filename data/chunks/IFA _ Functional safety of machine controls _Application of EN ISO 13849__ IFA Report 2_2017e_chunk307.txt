multiplication/load adaptation. The actual prevention of the hazardous movement, for example by separation of the electrical or hydraulic energy, is dependent upon the application and is not shown here. • Faults in the actuating mechanism are detected in S1/S2 to the greatest extent possible by the use of two con- tacts employing different principles (break and make contact combination). In accordance with Recommendation for Use (RfU) CNB/M/11.033/R/E Rev 06, mechanical faults on the actuators can be excluded when they satisfy IEC 60947-5-1. 230 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS S1/13-14 S2/21-22 K2 K1 S2/13-14 S1/21-22 K3 • Faults in S1/S2 and in K2/K3 (with break contacts in the feedback circuit) are detected in K1 and lead to sustained de-energization via K2 and K3. All individual faults are detected at or prior to the next demand of the safety func- tion. • Frequent actuation of the electromechanical elements results in a sufficiently high test rate (forced dynamics). Design features • Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. Protective circuits (such as contact protection), as described in subclause 8.1, are implemented. • The actuators S1 and S2 of the two-hand control satisfy IEC 60947-5-1. In accordance with RfU CNB/M/11.033/R/E Rev 06, mechanical faults can therefore be excluded. • Faults in the conductors to S1 and S2 are detected in the logic device. If this were not possible, the conditions to EN ISO 13849-2, Table D.4 for a fault exclusion for conductor short circuits would have to be observed. Owing to the low currents, pushbuttons with gold-plated contacts are recommended. • Refer to EN 574, subclauses 8 and 9 with regard to fitting of the pushbuttons and measures for the avoidance of accidental actuation and defeating. The safety distance from the hazard zone must be sufficiently
