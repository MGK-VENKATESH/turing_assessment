personnel safety function B1 fitted to the safeguard and of the inching button S1, and makes these states available on the functional bus. This information is interpreted by the functional PLC K3 and results in the stop function on the frequency inverter T1 being initiated when the guard door is opened. A signal for the fastest possible stop is transmitted over the functional bus for this purpose. The I/O module K2 and the monitoring PLC K4, which communicate over a dedicated monitoring bus, operate redundantly to K1 and K3. The deceleration ramp is monitored in the functional PLC K3 through the enco- der G2 and in the monitoring PLC K4 through the encoder G1. Once a standstill has been reached, or in the event of detection of a fault during stopping, the integral STO safety function is initiated by K3 and K4 via the two STO inputs STO1 and STO2 of T1. • The open state of the safeguard is detected in K3 and K4 via B1, K1 and K2 as described above. K3 and K4 then monitor the specified limited speed (SLS) redundantly of each other through G2 and G1. If this speed is exceeded, K3 and K4 initiate SS1-r independently of each other, as described above. • With B1 actuated, only inching mode by means of S1 with safely limited speed is permissible. Releasing of S1 is detected redundantly in K1 to K4 and leads, as described above for the safety-related stop function and SLS, to safe stop 1 of the drive (SS1-r). • In accordance with EN 1010-1, a single position switch B1 is sufficient. The majority of faults in S1 are detected and controlled by a special actuating procedure, which forces a signal change: when S1 is pressed for the first time, an acoustic warning (signal
