European directives. • The application of harmonized standards provides the “presumption of conformity”, i.e., the presumption the machine meets the requirements of the directive. In other words, if you select and apply the right standards for your machine or system, you can assume that you will meet the legal requirements. In specific cases the obligations on the manufacturer can go beyond the content of the standards if, for example, a standard no longer reflects the state of the art. • There are type-A standards (basic safety standards), type-B standards (generic safety standards), and type-C standards (standards on the safety of machinery). If a type-C standard exists, it has priority over the type-A or type-B standard. Test bodies, insurance providers and market surveillance Test bodies Test bodies providing safety advice Companies that want to know whether their machines are compliant with the applicable European directives and standards can obtain advice on safety aspects. Accredited test bodies Accredited test bodies are test bodies that certify compliance with the test procedures and test criteria from recognized national institutions. These test bodies may include institutions for occupational safety and health which generally employ highly competent specialists. Notified bodies Each EU member state has the obligation to nominate test bodies as per the minimum requirements defined in the Machinery Directive, and to notify the European Commission in Brussels of these test bodies for listing. Only these test bodies are authorized to perform EU-type examinations and to issue EU type examination certifi‐ cates for the machinery and safety components listed in Annex IV of the Machinery Directive. Not all notified test bodies can test every type of product or machine. Many test bodies are only notified for specific areas.
