the volumetric flow without leakage. Valve 1V4, which also controls the direction of movement of the cylinder, is a piston-type directional control valve that also exhibits a certain degree of leakage in the closed centre position. Although the valve 1V3 is only indirectly involved in the stop function, it may have a negative impact upon the safety function. Should 1V3 and 1V4 stick at 222 8 Circuit examples for SRP/CS B1 1V4 K2 B2 1V3 1V5 1S3 K1 1S4 1S5 the same time, pressure builds up at the end of the cylinder above the piston, whilst the end below it remains shut off by 1V5. Owing to the pressure ratio in the cylinder, the pressure-relief valve 1V6 then opens and the ram of the press drops. • Failure of one of the valves does not result in loss of the safety function. All valves are actuated cyclically. • Each valve is equipped with a position monitoring facility, 1S3, 1S4 and 1S5, for fault detection purposes. Failure of any of the three valves is detected in the conventional PLC K1, which prevents the next hazardous movement from being initiated following a fault. • A single fault in one safety component does not result in loss of the safety function. In addition, single faults are detected at or prior to the next demand. An accumulation of undetected faults does not result in loss of the safety function. Design features • Basic and well-tried safety principles and the requirements of Category B are observed. Protective circuits (such as contact protection) as described in the initial paragraphs of Chapter 8 are implemented. • A stable arrangement of the guard is assured for actuation of the position switch. • The switch B1 is a position switch with a direct opening contact in accordance with IEC
