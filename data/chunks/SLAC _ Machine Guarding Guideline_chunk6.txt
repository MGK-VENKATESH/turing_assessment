hazards, they may provide the operator with an extra margin of safety. Sound judgment is needed in their use. 19 July 2021 SLAC-I-730-0A21T-016-R003 9 of 12 SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory Environment, Safety & Health Division Machine and Portable Tools | Machine Safeguarding Guideline 2.6.1 Awareness Barriers Awareness barriers do not provide physical protection but serve only as reminders to a person that he or she is approaching the danger area. Generally, awareness barriers are not considered adequate where continual exposure to the hazard exists. 2.6.2 Protective Shields Aids such as clear protective shields do not give complete protection from machine hazards, but do provide some protection from flying particles, splashing cutting oils, and coolants. They provide the operator with an extra margin of safety. 19 July 2021 SLAC-I-730-0A21T-016-R003 10 of 12 SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory Environment, Safety & Health Division Machine and Portable Tools | Machine Safeguarding Guideline 2.6.3 Hand-feeding or retrieving Tools Hand-feeding or retrieving tools can place or remove stock. Hand-feeding tools are intended for placing and removing materials into the in the danger area of a machine. Hand-feeding tools are not a point-of- operation guard or protection device and shall not be used in lieu of appropriate safeguards, but as a supplement. A typical use would be for reaching in the danger area of a press or press brake. Another example would be a push stick or block used when feeding stock into a saw blade. When it becomes necessary for hands to be in close proximity to the blade, the push stick or block may provide a few inches of safety and prevent a severe injury. 2.7 Guard Construction Builders of many single-purpose machines provide point-of-operation and power-transmission safeguards as standard equipment. Unfortunately, not all machines in use have built-in safeguards provided by the manufacturer. Guards
