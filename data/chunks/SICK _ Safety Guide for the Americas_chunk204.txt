P PFHd Probability of dangerous failure Mean probability of a dangerous failure per hour (1/h). - 3-81 per hour PL Performance level Discrete level used to specify the ability of the safety-related parts of a control - 3-81 system to perform a safety function under foreseeable conditions (ISO 13849-1/ EN ISO 13849-1). Placing on the market Making available for the first time in the European Community machinery or partly - 6-3 completed machinery with a view to distribution or use, whether for reward or free of charge (Machinery Directive 2006-42-EC) Positive opening Positive opening on switches signifies that there must be positive transmission of - 3-23 force between actuator and switching element. The actuating mechanism must be designed so that even in the event of mechanical failure (a spring fracturing or contact welding, for example) the contacts open reliably and remain open in the actuated state (IEC 60947-5-1/EN 60947-5-1). Presence detection Secondary protective device for machines and/or systems that can be accessed - 3-48 from the floor and on which the system must be prevented from starting while the operator is inside (safety function: preventing start). Protective field The area in which the test object specified by the manufacturer is detected by the - 3-30 electro-sensitive protective equipment (g ESPE). • Safety light curtain: The protective field lies between the sender unit and the receiver unit. It is defined by the protective field height and the protective field width. • Safety laser scanner: The protective field secures the hazard zone on a ma- chine or vehicle. The field is defined by the scanning range, scanning angle, response time, and resolution of the device used (see technical specifications).
