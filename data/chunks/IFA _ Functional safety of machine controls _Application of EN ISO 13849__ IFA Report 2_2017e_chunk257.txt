up and braking. • For comparison of command disconnection on the “STO1/STO2” inputs on the FI, a duration of sufficient length is selected to allow for variation in the drop-out delay of K1. • The contactor relays K1 and K2 possess mechanically linked contact elements in accordance with IEC 60947-5-1, Annex L. • The contacts of the stop button S1 and of the emergency stop device S4 are direct opening contacts in accordance with IEC 60947-5-1, Annex K. • The standard component K4 is employed in accordance with the information in subclause 6.3.10. • The software (SRASW) is programmed in accordance with the requirements for PL c (downgraded owing to diver- sity) and the guidance in subclause 6.3.10. • If the brake Q2 is provided for functional reasons only, i.e. it is not involved in performance of the safety function, it is disregarded in the calculation of the probability of failure, as in this example. A condition for this procedure is that coasting down of the drive in the event of a failure of the stop function, in which case de-energization is effected by means of STO alone, must not be associated with an unacceptably high residual risk. The involvement of a brake in performance of the safety function in conjunction with the use of an FI is described in Example 23 (revolving door control). • The ESPE K3, for example in the form of a light curtain, satisfies the requirements for Type 4 to IEC 61496-1 and IEC 61496-2, and for PL e. Calculation of the probability of failure • The probability of failure PFH of safe stopping initiated by the emergency stop device S4 or by the ESPE is calcu- D lated.
