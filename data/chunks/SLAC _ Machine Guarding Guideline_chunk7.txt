designed and built by the manufacturer offer two main advantages: 7. They usually conform to the design and function of the machine. 8. They can be designed to strengthen the machine in some way or to serve some additional functional purposes. Guards fabricated by the machine tool user are sometimes necessary for a variety of reasons, and offer these advantages:  Often, with older machinery, they are the only practical solution. 19 July 2021 SLAC-I-730-0A21T-016-R003 11 of 12 SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory Environment, Safety & Health Division Machine and Portable Tools | Machine Safeguarding Guideline  In older plants, they may be the only choice for mechanical power transmission apparatus, where machinery is not powered by individual motor drives.  They permit options for point-of-operation safeguards when skilled personnel and machinery are available to make them.  They can be designed and built to fit unique and even changing situations.  They can be installed on individual dies and feeding mechanisms. User-fabricated guards also have disadvantages. They may  Not conform well to the configuration and function of the machine  Be poorly designed or built  Not comply with regulatory requirements 3 References SLAC Environment, Safety, and Health Manual (SLAC-I-720-0A29Z-001)  Chapter 25, “Machine and Portable Tools” – Machine and Portable Tools: Machine Tool Requirements (SLAC-I-730-0A21S-056) – Machine and Portable Tools: Machine Safeguarding Requirements (SLAC-I-730-0A21S-005) Other Documents  Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).
