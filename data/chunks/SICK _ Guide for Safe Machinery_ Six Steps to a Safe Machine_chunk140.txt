areas? 10 Are the components used for the protective devices integrated in accordance with the Yes ⃞ No ⃞ manufacturer’s instructions? 11 Are the given safety functions effective at every setting of the operating mode selector Yes ⃞ No ⃞ switch? 12 Are the protective devices effective during the entire time in which the machine functions to Yes ⃞ No ⃞ be safeguarded are taking place? 13 Once initiated, will the dangerous machine functions be ceased when switching the pro‐ tective devices off or when changing the operating mode, or when switching to another Yes ⃞ No ⃞ protective device? 14 Are the instructions for the operator, that are supplied with the protective device, attached Yes ⃞ No ⃞ in a clearly visible manner? Verification of functional safety Machine-specific type-C standards and some type-B standards require a target level for safety functions. There are two different methods for determining the level of safety achieved: • Determining the performance level (PL) achieved as per ISO 13849-1 • Determining the safety integrity level achieved (SIL) according to IEC 62061 PL a b c d e ISO 13849-1 PFH SIL D 1 2 3 IEC 62061 Figure 109: Illustration of the relationship between performance level and safety integrity level Both methods can be used to check whether the required level of safety has been achieved. The PFH value is D determined as a quantitative measure for this purpose. In both examples (see figure 110), sensor and logic data is available but power control element data is not. 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 129 Subject to change without notice 3D – VERIFYING THE SAFETY FUNCTION NOTE • Performance level (PL): Capability of safety-related components to perform a safety function under foreseea‐ ble conditions in order to achieve the expected
