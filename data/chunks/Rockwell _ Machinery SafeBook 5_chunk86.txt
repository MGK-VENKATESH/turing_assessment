the fi nal calculation. SISTEMA and the standard both use the same principles and formulae. It is also interesting to note that the subsystem approach is also used in EN/IEC 62061. The system we have been using as an example is just one of the fi ve basic types of system architectures that the standard designates. Anyone familiar with the Categories system will recognise our example as representative of either Category 3 or 4. The standard uses the fi ve original Categories from the former EN 954. It calls them Designated Architecture Categories. The requirements for the Categories are almost [but not quite] identical to those given in EN 954-1. The Designated Architecture Categories are represented by the following fi gures. It is important to note that they can be applied either to a complete system or a subsystem. The diagrams should not necessarily be regarded as a physical structure, they are intended more as a graphical representation of conceptual requirements. Input Logic Output Device Device Designated Architecture Category B Designated Architecture Category B must use basic safety principles [see annex of (EN) ISO 13849-2]. The system or subsystem can fail in the event of a single fault. See (EN) ISO 13849-1 for full requirements. 73 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery Input Logic Output Device Device Designated Architecture Category 1 Designated Architecture Category 1 has the same structure as Category B and can still fail in the event of a single fault. But because it must also use well tried safety principles [see annex of (EN) ISO 13849-2] this is less likely than for Category B. See (EN) ISO 13849-1 for full requirements.
