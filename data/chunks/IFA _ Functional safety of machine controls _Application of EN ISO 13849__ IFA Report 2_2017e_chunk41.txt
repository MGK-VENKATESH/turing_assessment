of the motor is kept within specified limit values. SSR Safe speed range The speed of the motor is kept within specified limit values. STR Safe torque range The torque of the motor (the force in the case of linear motors) is kept within specified limit values. The manner in which a safety function is executed may • Specification of safety-related parameters, such as the take very different forms. For this reason, certain characte- maximum permissible speed ristics must be observed at selection, and specified on a case-by-case basis. These include: • Required Performance Level PL r • Use in different operating modes (e.g. automatic mode, Detailed information on the definition of safety functions setup mode, troubleshooting) can be found in SISTEMA Cookbook 6, “Definition of safety functions: what is important?” [23]. • Use of different safety functions according to whether the power supply is available or has failed (see also 5.3.2 Examples in which the definition of the subclause 4.3 of [22]) safety function has an influence upon subsequent calculation of the PFH D • Response(s) to tripping of the safety function • Response(s) to detection of a fault in the safety function Later chapters will show how the average probability of a dangerous failure per hour (PFH ) can be calculated for D • Response time a safety function. The foundation for this is however laid at this stage, with definition of the safety function. By its • Frequency of actuation nature, the technical implementation of a safety func- tion determines the type and scale of the components • Priority, in cases where several safety functions may be re quired for it. The definition of the safety function thus active simultaneously has a considerable influence upon determination of the 30 5 Safety functions and their contribution to risk
