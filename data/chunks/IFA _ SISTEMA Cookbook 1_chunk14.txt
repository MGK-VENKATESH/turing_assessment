Figure 15 d) For each two-channel subsystem, faults must be considered which would cause both channels to fail for the same reason (CCF). Of these, Category 2 (functional channel and test channel) and Categories 3 and 4 (two functional channels in each case) are affected. Entry is made in the subsystem (1.) under "CCF" (2.) by selection of the measures to be taken (Figure 16). At least 65 points must be reached. The number of points reached can be entered directly or compiled by a library of measures (3. and 4.). 22.. 11.. 33.. 44.. Figure 16 SISTEMA Cookbook (Version 1.0) - 19 - 4 Transfer to SISTEMA 4.6.1 Entering blocks Once the subsystems have been formed, further specification is necessary (exception: 4.5 Encapsulated subsystems). When the Category of a subsystem is selected, SISTEMA creates the relevant channels (CH). Under "Channel", the blocks (BL ) are added corre- sponding to the individual components of a channel. If no further subdivision of the blocks is required, the procedure can continue with 4.6.3. If a block is to be further subdivided into elements (always necessary with components for which the B is stated), the following set- 10d tings are required: a) In block (1.) under "MTTF " (2.), select "Determine MTTF -value from elements" (3.) d d (Figure 17). 22.. 33..
