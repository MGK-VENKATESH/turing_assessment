For this consideration we are presuming that an injury is inevitable and we are only concerned with its severity. You should assume that the operator is exposed to the hazardous motion or process. The severity of injury should be assessed according to the factors given in the chosen methodology. 26 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety Strategy For example as follows: • Death, losing an eye or arm • Permanent effect, e.g. losing fi ngers. • Reversible effect and requires medical attention • Reversible effect and requires fi rst aid Frequency of exposure Frequency of exposure answers the question of how often is the operator or the maintenance person exposed to the hazard. The frequency of exposure to hazard can be classifi ed according to the factors given in the chosen methodology. For example as follows: • Greater than once per hour • Between once per hour and once per day • Between once per day and once per two weeks • Between once per two weeks and once per year • Lower than once per year Probability of injury You should assume that the operator is exposed to the hazardous motion or process. The probability of occurrence of a hazardous event can be classifi ed according to the factors given in the chosen methodology. By considering the characteristics of the machine, expected human behaviours and other factors the probability of occurrence can be classifi ed. For example as follows: • Negligible • Rare • Possible • Likely • Very High Possibility of avoidance By considering how people will interact with the machine and other characteristics such as speed of motion start-up, the possibility of avoiding injury can be classifi ed according to the factors given in the chosen methodology. For example as follows: • Likely • Possible • Impossible 27 MACHINERY
