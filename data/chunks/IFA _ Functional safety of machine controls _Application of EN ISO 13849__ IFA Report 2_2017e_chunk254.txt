op D • The contactor relays K4 and K5 have a B value of 1,000,000 cycles [M]. At actuation once every 10 minutes, n is 10D op 17,520 cycles per year and the MTTF is 570 years. D • The manufacturer states a PFH of 3.0 · 10-9 per hour [M] for the safety module K2. D • DC : the DC of 99% for the contacts B2.1 and B2.2 is attributable to direct monitoring in K2. The DC of 99% for K4 avg and K5 is attributable to direct monitoring in K2 by means of mechanically linked contacts. Averaging results in a DC of 99% (“high”). avg • Adequate measures against common cause failure (70 points): separation (15), FMEA (5), overvoltage protection etc. (15) and environmental conditions (25 + 10) • For the safety function “access to a hazardous movement is prevented by means of a guard door with guard locking”, the average probability of dangerous failure PFH is 5.2 · 10-8 per hour. This satisfies PL e. However, since D the position switch (B2) for monitoring of the locking element and the associated actuating mechanism is present only once, the PL is limited to d. • For the safety function “release of guard locking: opening of the guard is possible only once the motor has come to a halt”, the probability of failure is determined only by the sin/cos encoder B4 and the standstill monitor K7. According to the manufacturer‘s information, the PFH for the sin/cos encoder B4 is 1.2 · 10-8 per hour. A PFH of D D 2.0 · 10-8 per hour is stated for the standstill monitor K7 [M]. The PFH of this safety function is 3.2 · 10-8 per hour. More detailed reference • DGUV Informative publication 203-079: Auswahl und Anbringung von Verriegelungseinrichtungen 203-079
