the rate of all dangerous failures. Subsystem C Subsystem Subsystem element 1 element n De1 Den Diagnostic function(s) Subsystem logical architecture C 92 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 System Design According to IEC/EN 62061 λDssC = λDe1 (1-DC1)+ . . . + λDen (1-DCn) PFHDssC = ʎDssC These formulae include the diagnostic coverage, DC, for each of the subsystem elements. The failure rates of each of the subsystems are reduced by the diagnostic coverage of each subsystem. The fourth example of a subsystem architecture is shown next. This subsystem is single fault tolerant and includes a diagnostic function. The potential for common cause failure must also be considered with single fault tolerant systems. Subsystem D Subsystem element 1 λ Common De1 cause failure Diagnostic Function(s) Subsystem element 2 λ De2 Subsystem logical architecture D If the subsystem elements are the different, the following formulae are used: ʎDssD = (1 - β)2 {[ʎDe1 x ʎDe2 x (DC1+ DC2)] x T2 / 2 + [ʎDe1 x ʎDe2 x (2- DC1 - DC2)] x T1 / 2 } + β x (ʎDe1 + ʎDe2 ) / 2 PFHDssD = ʎDssD If the subsystem elements are the same, the following formulae are used: ADssD = (1 - β)2 {[λDe2 x 2 x DC] x T2 / 2 + [λDe2 x (1-DC)] x T1 }+ β x λDe PFHDssD = ʎDssD Notice that both formulas use one additional parameter, T2 the diagnostic interval. This is just a periodic check of the function. It is a less comprehensive test than the Proof Test. 93 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery As an example, assume the following values for the example where the subsystem elements are identical: β = 0.05 λDe = 1 x 10-6 failures/hour T1 = 87600 hours (10 years) T2 = 2 hours
