Features: any logic depth, word level Several measures can be applied in the higher-level control system against the transmission faults mentioned above, e.g., sequential numbering of safety-related messages or defined times for incoming messages with acknowledgment. Protocol extensions based on the fieldbus used include such measures. In the ISO/OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) layer model, they act over the transport layer and, therefore, use the fieldbus with all its components as a “black channel,” without modifica- tion. Examples of established fieldbus systems include but are not limited to: • AS-i Safety at Work • DeviceNet Safety • PROFIsafe 3-68 GUIDE FOR SAFE MACHINERY | SICK 7028282/2014-09-08 Subject to change without notice Risk reduction Safeguarding (technical protective measures) Selection criteria The criteria for the selection of a control system model are ini- tially the number of safety functions to be implemented as well as the scope of the logical operators on the input signals. The functionality of the logical operators — e.g., simple AND, flipflop, or special functions such as muting — also affects the
