the reliability of electronic devices it is usual to use analysis and calculation. We can fi nd good data for the individual components in reliability data handbooks. We can use analysis to determine which component failure modes are dangerous. It is acceptable and usual to average out the component failure modes as 50% safe and 50% dangerous. This normally results in relatively conservative data. IEC 61508 provides formulae that can be used to calculate the overall probability of dangerous failure [PFH or PFD] of the device i.e. the subsystem. The formulae are quite complex and take into account [where applicable] component reliability, potential for common cause failure [beta factor], diagnostic coverage [DC], functional test interval and proof test interval. The good news is that this complex calculation will normally be done by the device manufacturer. Both EN/IEC 62061 and (EN) ISO 13849-1 accept a subsystem calculated in this way to IEC 61508. The resulting PFH can be used directly into either Annex K of (EN) ISO 13849-1 or the D SISTEMA calculation tool. 79 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery Software: Failures of software are inherently systematic in nature. Failures are caused by the way it is conceived, written or compiled. Therefore all failures are caused by the system under which it is produced, not by its use. Therefore in order to control the failures we must control that system. Both IEC 61508 and (EN) ISO 13849- 1 provide requirements and methodologies for this. We do not need to go into detail here other than to say they use the classic V model. Embedded software is an issue for the designer of the device. The usual approach is to develop embedded software in accordance with the formal methods laid out in IEC 61508 part 3. When it
