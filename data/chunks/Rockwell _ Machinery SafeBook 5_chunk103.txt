of failure of the subsystems. Simplifi ed formulae are provided for the calculation of common subsystem architectures (described later in text). Where these formulae are not appropriate it will be necessary to use more complex calculation methods such as Markov models. The Probability of Dangerous Failure (PFH ) of each subsystem D are then added together to determine the total PFH for the system. Table 3 of D the standard can then be used to determine which Safety Integrity Level (SIL) is appropriate to that range of PFH . D SIL PFH D (Safety Integrity Level) (Probability of dangerous failure per hour) 3 ≥10-8 to <10-7 2 ≥10-7 to <10-6 1 ≥10-6 to <10-5 Probabilities of Dangerous Failure for SILs The PFH data for a subsystem will usually be provided by the manufacturer. Data D for Rockwell Automation safety components and systems is available at: www.rockwellautomation.com, under Solutions & Services > Safety Solutions IEC/EN 62061 also makes it clear that reliability data handbooks can be used if and where applicable. For low complexity electromechanical devices, the failure mechanism is usually linked to the number and frequency of operations rather than just time. Therefore for these components the data will derived from some form of testing (e.g. B10 testing as described in the chapter on (EN) ISO 13849-1). Application based information such as the anticipated number of operations per year is then required in order to convert the B10d or similar data to PFH . D 88 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 System Design According to IEC/EN 62061 NOTE: In general the following is true (taking into account a factor to change years to hours): PFH = 1/MTTF D D However, it is important to understand that, for a dual channel system (with or without diagnostics), it is not correct to use 1/
