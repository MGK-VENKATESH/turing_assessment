These parts include sensors, logic units, power control elements, for example, as well as drive and work elements. This selection is usually made while developing the safety concept. A safety function can be implemented using one or more safety-related component(s). Several safety functions can share one or more components. Control systems shall be designed to avoid hazardous situations. It must be possible to start machinery only by voluntary actuation of a control device provided for the purpose. If a machine restart will pose a hazard, then restarting on switching on the supply voltage shall be excluded by technical means. If a machine restart will not pose a hazard, then restarting without operator intervention (automatic restart) is permitted. Subsystems of the safety-related part of a machine control system Event Signal Signal Signal Motion Power control Sensor Logic unit Drive element element The drive elements shall be designed according to “good engineering practice”. They are only part of the safety function if their failure may lead to a hazard (e.g., suspended axes). Subsystems of the safety-related part of a machine control system Figure 35: Subsystems of a machine controller Decisive factors The following features shall be considered when developing the safety concept: • Features of the machine • Features of the surroundings • Human aspects • Features of the
