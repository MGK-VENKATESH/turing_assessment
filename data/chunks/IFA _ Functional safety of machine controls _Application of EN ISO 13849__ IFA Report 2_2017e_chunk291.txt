is 100 years (“high”). The position switch B2 exhibits a limited operation time of 17.1 years. Its replacement in good time is recommended. • DC : the DC of 99% for B1 and B2 is based upon plausibility monitoring of the break/make contact combinations avg in K1 and K3. The DC of 99% for the contactors Q1 and Q2 is derived from monitoring at each energization of K1. The DC values stated correspond to the DC of the subsystem concerned. avg • Adequate measures against common cause failure in the subsystems B1/B2 and Q1/Q2 (70 points): separation (15), well-tried components (5), protection against overvoltage etc. (15) and environmental conditions (25 + 10) The subsystems B1/B2 and Q1/Q2 each correspond to Category 4 with a high MTTF (100 years) and high DC D avg (99%). This results in an average probability of dangerous failure in each case of 2.3 · 10-9 per hour. Following addi- tion of the subsystem K1, the average probability of dangerous failure is 4.6 · 10-9 per hour. This satisfies PL e.
