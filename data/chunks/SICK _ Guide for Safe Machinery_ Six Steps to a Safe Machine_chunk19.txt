directive(s) are defined. 3. Once the standard has been approved by the responsible technical committee in a final vote, it is reviewed by the European Commission to determine whether the requirements contained in the standard sufficient to fulfill the requirement of Annex I of the Machinery Directive listed in its Annex ZA. Annex ZA may list one, several or all of the essential health and safety requirements. 4. If the European Commission considers that the standard adequately supports the relevant requirements of Annex ZA, the standard is listed in the Official Journal of the European Union as a harmonized standard. NOTE • A harmonized European standard is used as a reference and replaces all national standards on the same subject. • The compliance of a safety component or a machine with the applicable harmonized standards provides presumption of conformity with the essential health and safety requirements defined in directives, e.g., in the Machinery Directive. NOTE A list of the standards with presumption of conformity with the directives is available at ec.europa.eu. 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 19 Subject to change without notice § – LAWS, DIRECTIVES, STANDARDS NOTE • The application of standards, independent of whether they are harmonized or not, is not a requirement of the Machinery Directive. However, if harmonized standards are applied, the so-called “presumption of conformity” applies, according to which it is assumed that the machine meets the relevant essential safety and health requirements of the Machinery Directive. • If a type-C standard exists for a machine type, it takes precedence over type-A and type-B standards. In this case, only the type-C standard applied justifies the presumption of conformity for meeting the requirements of the Machinery Directive. Summary: Standards • European standards specify in more detail the objectives defined in the
