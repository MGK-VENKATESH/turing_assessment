the hazard may be initiated by unexpected startup. The main task of the safety system designer is to prevent hazardous conditions and to prevent unexpected startup. The safety function can often be described with multi-part requirements. For example, the safety function initiated by an interlocking guard has three parts: 1. The hazards protected by the guard cannot operate until the guard is closed; 2. Opening the guard will cause the hazard to stop if operational at the time of the opening; and 3. The closure of the guard does not restart the hazard protected by the guard. 60 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety Related Control Systems & Functional Safety When stating the safety function for a specifi c application, the word “hazard” must be changed to the specifi c hazard. The source of the hazard must not be confused with the results of the hazard. Crushing, cutting, and burning are results of a hazard. An example of a hazard source is a motor, ram, knife, torch, pump, laser, robot, end-effector, solenoid, valve, other type of actuator, or a mechanical hazard involving gravity. In discussing safety systems, the phrase “at or before a demand is placed on the safety function” is used. What is a demand on the safety function? Examples of demands placed on the safety function are the opening of an interlocked guard, the breaking of a light curtain, the stepping onto a safety mat, or the pressing of an emergency stop. An operator is demanding that the hazard either stop or remain de-energized if it is already stopped. The safety-related parts of the machine control system execute the safety function. The safety function is not executed by a single device, for example, just by the guard. The interlock on the guard sends a command to a logic device, which
