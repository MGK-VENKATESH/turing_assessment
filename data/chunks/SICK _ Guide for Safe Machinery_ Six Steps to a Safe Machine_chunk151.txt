For example: • Organization and competence • Rules governing design (e.g., specifications templates, coding guidelines) • Test concept and test criteria • Documentation and configuration management 7) Result 10-4 The PL of the subsystem can be determined from the figure for a determining the PL of the subsystem (see "Determining the achieved b Performance Level (PL)", page 130). In this case, the PL “e” has c been achieved. The resulting PFH value of 2.47 × 10–8 for this subsystem can be d D obtained from a detailed table in ISO 13849-1. The high DC means e that the dual-channel structure meets the requirements of category 4.

Alternative: Determining the achieved safety integrity level (SIL) The achieved safety integrity level (SIL) according to IEC 62061 is determined based on the following criteria: • The safety integrity of the hardware Structural restrictions (SIL claim limit) ° Probability of dangerous hardware failures (PFH ) ° D •
