| Guide for Safe Machinery 5 Subject to change without notice FOREWORD Foreword Figure 1: Machine safety inspection Safe machines increase legal certainty for the manufacturer and user. Machine operators expect to be offered only safe machinery or devices. This expectation exists worldwide. There are also regulations on the protection of operators of machinery worldwide. Such regulations are different depending on countries and regions. However, there is broad agreement on the process to be applied during the manufacture and upgrade of machinery: During the design and manufacture of machinery, the machine manufacturer shall identify and evaluate all possible hazards and hazardous points by undertaking a risk assessment. Based on this risk assessment, the machine manufacturer shall take suitable design measures to eliminate or reduce the risk. If the risk cannot be eliminated by these design measures or the remaining risk is not tolerable, the machine manufacturer shall select and apply suitable protective devices, and provide information on the residual risks if necessary. To ensure the intended measures work correctly, overall validation is necessary. This overall validation shall evaluate the design and technical measures, as well as the organizational measures in context. About this guide What does the guide contain? You have before you a comprehensive guide on machine safety requirements and on the selection and use of protective devices. We will show you various ways in which you can safeguard machinery and protect persons against accidents taking into account the applicable European directives, regulations, and standards. The exam‐ ples and statements given are the result of our many years of practical experience and are to be considered typical applications. 6 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice For better orientation and guidance through the guide, § we have divided the path to
