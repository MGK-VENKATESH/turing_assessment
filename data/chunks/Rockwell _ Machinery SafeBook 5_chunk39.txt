to facilitate awareness of any residual risk. 33 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery Chapter 4: Implementation of protective measures When the risk assessment shows that a machine or process carries a risk of injury, the hazard must be eliminated or contained. The manner in which this is achieved will depend on the nature of the machine and the hazard. Safety control system protective measures in conjunction with guarding either prevent access to a hazard or prevent dangerous motion at a hazard when access is available. Typical examples of safety control system protective measures are discussed later and include interlocked guards, light curtains, safety mats, two-hand controls and enabling switches. Emergency stop devices and systems are associated with safety related control systems but they are not direct protective systems, they should only be regarded as complementary protective measures. Preventing Access with Fixed Enclosing Guards If the hazard is on a part of the machinery which does not require access, a guard should be permanently fi xed to the machinery. These types of guards must require tools for removal. The fi xed guards must be able to 1) withstand their operating environment, 2) contain projectiles where necessary, and 3) not create hazards by having, for example, sharp edges. Fixed guards may have openings where the guard meets the machinery or openings due to the use of a wire mesh type enclosure. Windows provide convenient ways to monitor machine performance. Care must be taken in the selection of the material used, as chemical interactions with cutting fl uids, ultra-violet rays and simple aging could cause the window materials to degrade over time. The size of the openings must prevent the operator from reaching the hazard. Table O-10 in U.S. OHSA 1910.217 (f) (4), ISO 13854, Table D-1 of ANSI
