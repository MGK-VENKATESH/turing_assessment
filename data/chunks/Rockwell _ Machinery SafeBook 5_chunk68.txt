determine the best depth penetration factor. For a normal approach to a light curtain or area scanner, whose object sensitivity is less than 64mm (2.5in), the ANSI and Canadian standards use: Dpf = 3.4 x (Object Sensitivity - 6.875mm), but not less than zero. For a normal approach to a light curtain or area scanner, whose object sensitivity is less than 40mm (1.57in), the ISO and EN standards use: C = 8 x (Object Sensitivity - 14 mm), but not less than 0 These two formulas have a cross over point at 19.3mm. For object sensitivity less than 19mm, the US CAN approach is more restrictive, as the light curtain or area scanner must be set back further from the hazard. For object sensitivities greater than 19.3mm, the ISO EN standard is more restrictive. Machine builders, who want to build one machine for use throughout the world, must take the worst case conditions from both equations. 57 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 Safety related control systems for machinery Reach-Through Applications When larger object sensitivities are used, the US CAN and ISO EN standards differ slightly on the depth penetration factor and the object sensitivity. The ISO EN value is 850mm where the US CAN value is 900mm. The standards also differ in the object sensitivity. Reach-Over Applications Both standards agree that the minimum height of the lowest beam should be 300mm, but differ with respect to the minimum height of the highest beam. The ISO EN states 900mm, whereas the US CAN states 1200mm. The value for the highest beam seems to be moot. When considering this to be a reach-through application, the height of the highest beam will have to be much higher to accommodate an operator in a standing position. If the operator can reach over the detection plane, then
