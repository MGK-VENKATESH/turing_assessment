movements in conjunction with the switching position of the directional control valve, with evaluation in a PLC (K1). K1 must not be used for the electrical drive of 1V3. • In order to prevent a systematic failure, the higher-level de-energization function (acting upon the hydraulic pump in this example) is checked at suitable intervals, e.g. daily. • For use in applications with infrequent operator intervention in the hazard zone. This enables the requirement of the designated architecture for Category 2 to be satisfied. The requirement is for testing to be performed immedi- ately upon a demand being made upon the safety function, and for the total time for detection of the failure and placing of the machine in a non-hazardous state, for example in consideration of the overrun, to be shorter than the time to attainment of the hazard (see also EN ISO 13855 and cf. subclause 6.2.14) • The standard component K1 is employed in accordance with the information in subclause 6.3.10. • The software (SRASW) is programmed in accordance with the requirements for PL b (downgraded owing to diver- sity) and the information in subclause 6.3. Calculation of the probability of failure • MTTF of the functional channel: an MTTF of 150 years is assumed for the directional control valve 1V3 [M]. This is D D also the MTTF value for the functional channel, which is first capped to 100 years. D • MTTF of the test channel: an MTTF value of 91 years [M] is assumed for the displacement measurement system D D 1S3. An MTTF value of 50 years [E] is assumed for the PLC K1. A B value of 1,300,000 cycles [S] applies for the D 10D contactor Q1. At actuation once daily on 240 working days, the MTTF value for Q1 is 54,166 years.
