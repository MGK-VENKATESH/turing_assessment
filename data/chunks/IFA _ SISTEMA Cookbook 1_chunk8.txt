analysis with reference to the examples from Chapter 2: SF = safety function SISTEMA Cookbook (Version 1.0) - 12 - 3 From the schematic circuit diagram to the safety-related block diagram Step 5a: Adding the redundant functional channel of the block(s) If the safety function is maintained by one or more redundant components in the event of a fault in the block under analysis (i.e. a second functional channel is present), these compo- nents are presented as blocks in a second functional channel (refer to the example in Table 1: Categories 3 and 4). In Example 1 (Figure 3), this applies to both B1 and Q2. The redundant functional channel B2-K1-Q1 is therefore added to both blocks. Note: The components of the redundant functional channel are thus used several times. This is a result of the phased procedure and should not be a hindrance at this stage. Blocks of which multiple instances exist are grouped together again in Step 8. If redundant components have been entered, a major basic criterion for Categories 3 and 4 has been met. A single fault in a component of the first or second functional channel must not result in loss of the safety function (single-fault tolerance). Note: In addition, Category 3 requires that, wherever reasonably possible, individual faults in components within the two functional channels should be detected. Step 5b: Is the safety function retained in the event of an accumulation of undetected faults? For the block under analysis here and its redundant functional channel, single-fault tolerance has been identified up to this point and Category 3 is satisfied. Are the criteria for Category 4 also met? For this purpose, the behaviour in the event of undetected faults occurring must be studied. If the safety function is retained in the event of an accumulation
