detection capability up to 40 mm (ISO 13855). If a person can pass the detection zone of the protective device, prevention of unexpected start-up is necessary, e.g., by means of a reset function of the ESPE.

Detection of the largest body part (torso) is sufficient for this purpose. Access protection is particularly suitable for protecting large areas and areas with large access points. A person who has passed the detection zone of the protective device is no longer detected. Access protection there‐ fore always requires prevention of unexpected start-up. Figure 55: Access protection of a machine using safety multi‐ beam sensors and deflector mirrors Hazardous area protection: detection of the presence of a person in the hazardous area Hazardous area protection is used to detect when a person approaches or is present in the hazardous area. This requires detection of the lower limbs or torso. Hazardous area protection is particularly suitable for machines where, for example, the hazardous area can‐ not be fully seen from the position of the reset push‐ button. Hazardous area protection does not require a reset function if the detection zone cannot be exited in the direction of the hazardous point. When entering the hazardous area, the dangerous state of the machine is stopped and starting is prevented.
