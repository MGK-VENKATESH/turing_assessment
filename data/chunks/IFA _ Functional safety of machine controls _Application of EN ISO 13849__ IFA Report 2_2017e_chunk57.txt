quality of the SRP/CS is indicated by one of five Performance Levels (PLs). Each of these PLs Once the precise safety function and its required risk corresponds to a range of the probability of a dangerous reduction in the form of the PL have been defined, failure per hour (Table 6.1, Page 40). In addition to the r design proper begins of the safety-related parts of the average probability of a dangerous failure per hour (PFH ), D control system (SRP/CS) that are to carry out the safety further measures, for example to enhance software function(s). The corresponding subclause from the robustness or to counter systematic failures, are required iterative design process of EN ISO 13849-1 is shown in in order for the corresponding PL to be attained.

It is followed by measures necessary for Correspondence between the probability of failure and the the control of systematic failures (subclause 6.1.2) and Performance Level ergonomic design aspects (subclause 6.1.3). Subclause 6.2 describes the Categories and the simplified method Performance Average probability of a dangerous based upon them for evaluation of the quantifiable Level (PL) failure per hour (PFH ) in h-1 D aspects. Subclause 6.3 then presents requirements a â‰¥ 10-5 to < 10-4 upon the software. Finally, subclause
