Therefore as a minimum the complementary block of the redundant channel should implement a different DC measure, with a DC value at least as high as the assumed DC by the process 288 Annex E Typical realisation in different technologies Mechanics Pneumatics Hydraulics Electrical systems (Programmable) electronics not relevant Timer as watchdog, where trigger points are within the program of the logic not relevant By the watchdog, where the test equipment does plausability checks of the behaviour of the logic Detection of e.g. welded Detection of latent faults in program- and contacts by triggering data memories, input/output ports, and readback interfaces Checking the watchdog reaction capa bility Interlocking Interlocking circuits circuits implemented by relays implemented by pneumatics not relevant see description of measure not relevant see description of measure not relevant see description of measure not relevant see description of measure not relevant see description of measure not relevant see description of measure not relevant see description of measure 289 Annex E The following requirement applies, in addition to the test electronics with separate tests for the memory and the and monitoring measures stated in Table E.2: should a DC processing unit (see Figure E.3).
