selected examples of the safety functions that is represented in the robot cell. Safety in control systems according to EN ISO 13849-1 | 11 Example 3 Safety system using Pluto Protection layout for a machining tool and industrial robot with high risks. Safety PLC Pluto Monitors safety components. Door 4 Door 3 Door 2 Station 2 Station 1 Door 1 Step 1 â€“ Risk assessment The workpieces to be machined are fed into the cell through a is breached, station 2 stops in a safe manner. By opening conveyor belt and positioned by the operator in the pneumatic doors 2 and 3 (also monitored by Eden) the conveyor belt machining tool in station 1. The operator starts station 1 and the pneumatic machining tool will stop safely. Manual manually. The pneumatic machining tool performs work on the reset must always be done after actuation by any safety workpiece in station 1. The operator then places the machined device. workpiece on the conveyor belt for transfer to station 2. The When the protection system requires a number of safety robot then takes the workpiece that is placed in the hydraulic devices and that multiple machines must be checked, safety press. The workpiece leaves the cell by transport out onto PLC Pluto is the most effective solution. If the protection the conveyor. The work that needs to be done in station 2 is, system also has to work by zones and in different modes of for example, to address operational disturbances in the press operation, this is another compelling reason to use Pluto. and the robot (a few times a week, F2). With Pluto, PL e can be achieved regardless of the number of Unexpected start-ups of the robot are expected to cause connected safety devices. serious injury (S2). The operator is
