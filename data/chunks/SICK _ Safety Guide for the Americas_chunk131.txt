possible to insert fingers or hands through the opening and towards the hazard zone before a stop signal is generated. ï€­ Calculation of the minimum distance for interlocking guards: ANSI B11.19, RIA TR R15.406, ISO 13855 Height requirements for guards Similar to the procedure for ESPE, the same procedure is also to be used for guards. Different calculation tables are to be 3 used depending on the potential hazard. c To prevent crawling beneath guards, it is normally sufficient if the guards start at 180 mm above the reference level (unless a C-Type standards states a more restrictive requirement). 200 mm (max) Parameters for determining the height requirements for guards Required height for guards in case of low risk according to ANSI B11.19, RIA TR R15.406, CSA Z432, and ISO 13857 Height a of the hazard Horizontal distance C to the hazard zone (mm) zone (mm) 2500 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2400 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 0 0 2200 600 600 500 500 400 350 250 0 0 0 2000 1100 900 700 600 500 350 0 0 0 0 1800 1100 1000 900 900 600 0 0 0 0 0 1600 1300 1000 900 900 500 0 0 0 0 0 1400 1300 1000 900 800 100 0 0 0 0 0 1200 1400 1000 900 500 0 0 0 0 0 0 1000 1400 1000 900 300 0 0 0 0 0 0 800 1300 900 600 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 600 1200 500 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 400 1200 300 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 200 1100 200 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1100 200 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
