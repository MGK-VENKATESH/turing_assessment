measures to control faults such as multiple channel signal processing, purely electronic control systems can achieve the necessary degree of reliability. Logic unit with software-based components Similar to automation technology, safety technology has developed from hard-wired auxiliary contactors through safety relays (some with configurable safety logic for which parameters can be set) to complex fail-safe PLCs. The concept of “proven components” and “proven safety principles” must be transferred to electrical and programma‐ ble electronic systems. The logical operators for the safety function are implemented in the software. Software is to be differentiated from firmware — developed and certified by the manufacturer of the control device — and the actual safety application, which is developed by the machine manufacturer using the functionality supported by the firmware. The choice and adjustment of the functions of logic units is offered in different levels of flexibility: • Parameterization • Configuration • Programming Parameterization Is the selection of properties from a defined pool of functionality by selector switch/software parameters at the time of commissioning. Features: low logic depth, AND/OR logic Configuration Flexible operators for defined function blocks in certified logic with a software-supported configuration interface, parameterization of times and configuration of the inputs/outputs of the control system, for example. Features: any logic depth, binary logic Figure 96: Example of linking the function blocks of a software-supported logic unit 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 115 Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION Programming Defines the logic as required using the functional‐ ity defined by the predefined programming language, mostly using certified function blocks.
