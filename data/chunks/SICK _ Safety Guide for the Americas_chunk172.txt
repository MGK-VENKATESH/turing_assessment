PFHd of the "actuator" subsystem 6) Evaluation of process measures Similarly, systematic aspects for the avoidance and management of faults must be taken into account. For example: • Organization and competence l • Rules governing design (e.g., specification templates, coding guide- lines) • Test concept and test criteria • Documentation and configuration management 1 1 Result Safe failure fraction Hardware fault tolerance In the final step, the structural restrictions must be considered. Based (SFF) on the available redundancy (hardware fault tolerance 1) and the SSF 0 1 of > 99%, the SIL claim limit for this subsystem is SILCL3. < 60% PFHd ≈β–×(λ D1 + λ D2 )×½SIL1 60 to < 90% SIL1 SIL2 ≈β×λ D 90 to < 99% SIL2 SIL3 C ≥ 99% ≈S0IL.305 × 0.1 × ---------------- SIL3 B 10d PFHd ≈1.9 × 10-9 - With the resulting SILCL data and the PFHd figure for the subsystem, the SIL achieved for the entire safety function can be 3 3 determined as described above (see “Safety integrity of the hardware” g 3-89). d d Useful support The verification methods described require know-how and experience of the concepts of performance level (PL) and safety integrity level (SIL). SICK offers associated services (see “How SICK supports you" g i-1). A suitable software tool can as- sist you in a systematic approach. The SISTEMA software assistant, which was developed by IFA and is available free of charge, supports an effective method for calculating performance level. SICK is able to offer a library of certified safety components for this tool. Furthermore, our seminars can provide you with practical know- how for the tasks you have to deal with on a day-to-day basis. - For further information about SISTEMA, the component library from SICK, and training, please refer to http://www.sick-safetyplus.com/ 7028282/2014-09-08 GUIDE FOR
