we go any further we should consider what types of data are required and also gain an understanding of how it is produced. The ultimate type of data required as part of the PL determination in the standard [and SISTEMA] is the PFH [the probability of dangerous failure per hour]. This is the same data as used in IEC 61508 and represented by the PFH abbreviation used in D IEC/EN 62061. PL PFH SIL D (Performance Level) (Probability of dangerous (Safety Integrity Level) failure per hour) a ≥10-5 to <10-4 None b ≥3 x 10-6 to <10-5 1 c ≥10-6 to <3 x 10-6 1 d ≥10-7 to <10-6 2 e ≥10-8 to <10-7 3 The table above shows the relationship between PFH and PL and SIL. For some D subsystems the PFH may be available from the manufacturer. This makes life D easier for the calculation. The manufacturer will usually have to perform some relatively complex calculation and/or testing on their subsystem in order to provide it. In the event that it is not available, (EN) ISO13849-1 gives us an alternative simplifi ed approach based on the average MTTF [mean time to a dangerous D failure] of a single channel. The PL [and therefore the PFH ] of a system or D subsystem can then be calculated using the methodology and formulae in the standard. It can be done even more conveniently using SISTEMA. 76 MACHINERY SAFEBOOK 5 System Design According to (EN) ISO 13849 NOTE: It is important to understand that, for a dual channel system (with or without diagnostics), it is not correct to use 1/PFH to determine the MTTF that is required D D by (EN) ISO 13849-1. The standard calls for the MTTF of a single channel. This D is a very different value to
