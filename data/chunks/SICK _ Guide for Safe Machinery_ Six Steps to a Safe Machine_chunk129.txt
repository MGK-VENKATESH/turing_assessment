account) safety) safety) 1) The element must be exactly matched to the inductance! Drive technology When considering safety functions, drives represent a central sub-function, as they pose a risk of unintentional movement, for example. The safety function extends from the sensor to the power-controlling element.

Braking systems and holding systems are also to be taken into account on axes subject to gravity. The actual motor is not part of the assessment. Servo amplifiers and frequency inverters In drive technology, three-phase motors with frequency inverters have largely replaced DC drives. The inverter generates an output voltage of variable frequency and amplitude from the fixed three-phase mains. Depending on design, regulated rectifiers can feed the energy absorbed by the intermediate circuit during braking back to the mains. The rectifier converts the electrical power supplied from the mains and feeds it to the DC intermediate circuit. To perform the required control function, the inverter forms a suitable revolving field for the motor using pulse-width modulation and semiconductor switches. The usual switching frequencies are between 4 kHz and 12 kHz.
