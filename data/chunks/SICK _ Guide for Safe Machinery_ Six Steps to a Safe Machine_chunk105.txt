contact with children or elderly people are much lower than those specified. • The bodily dimensions of children cannot be simulated using the specified test bodies. In this case, the dimensions of the test bodies should be taken from the relevant literature. Special case 4: Stationary application of an onboard ESPE The way in which some machines function requires that operators are located very close to the hazardous area. On press brakes, small pieces of plate must be held very close to the bending edge. Moving systems that form a protective field around the tool openings have proven to be practical protective devices. Because the hand approach speed of the operator is not taken into account in such applications, the general formula is not applicable. The requirements to be met by the resolution are very high and reflections on metal surfaces shall be prevented. For this reason, focused laser systems with image-based evaluation are used. This type of protection is defined in the type-C standards in conjunction with other measures (e.g., 3-pedal foot switch, automatic stop time measure‐ ment, requirement to wear gloves, etc.). NOTE - Safety of press brakes: EN 12622 (type-C standard) NOTE Specific know-how and equipment are required to measure the stopping/run-down time and the required minimum distance. SICK offers these measurements as a service. Approaches to calculating the minimum distance Solution approach 1: Perpendicular approach – hazardous point protection with presence detection The calculation results in a minimum distance of S = 320 mm (see figure 83). By using a safety light curtain with the best possible resolution (14 mm), this is already the optimal minimum distance. Two AOPDs are used to ensure that the person is detected everywhere in the hazardous area: • a vertical AOPD positioned according to the calculated minimum distance (vertical approach)
