Confi rm that the motor starts and that the machine begins to operate. Validation of Safe Response to Abnormal Operation - The safety system responds properly to all foreseeable faults with corresponding diagnostics. SensaGuard and 440C-CR30 Confi gurable Safety Relay Tests Test Step Verifi cation Pass/Fail Changes/ Modifi cations 1 Keep the guarded door closed. While the hazardous motion continues to run, remove the SensaGuard OSSD1 wire to terminal EI_00 of the 440C-CR30 safety relay. The 440C-CR30 safety relay must trip immediately. The red Fault status indicator LED on the relay must blink. Monitor all status indicator LEDs for proper operation and monitor the 440C-CR30 safety relay for proper status by using Connected Components Workbench software. 2 Reconnect the wire to E1_00. The
