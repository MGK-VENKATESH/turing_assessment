A differentiation is to • Automatic: Only if there is no dangerous machine state pre- be made between the concepts of mechanical release (using vailing (e.g., due to standstill monitoring devices) tools) and emergency or escape release (without tools). • Manual: The time between unlocking and the release of the Locking force required protective device shall be greater than the time it takes for An essential criterion when selecting a locking device is the the dangerous machine function to stop force required to hold the guard. Annex I of ISO 14119:2013 • When used for safeguarding purposes, the time-control or specifies maximum static forces that can be applied to the automatic signal to release the locking device must come most commonly used movable guards. from a certified safety component Mechanical and electrical integration of locking devices The same rules generally apply to locking devices as to inter- locking devices. In relation to the principle of positive opening, attention is to be paid to which contacts should be positively opened. Guard signaling contacts indicate when the actuator has been withdrawn, signifying the guard is open. These con- tacts may be positive opening, but this is not always required.
