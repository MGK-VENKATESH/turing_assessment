of PL (or SIL), PFH, category (or hardware fault tolerance) and mission time, subsystem elements are usually described in terms of MTTF or λ (device type 2) or B (device D D 10D type 3) in conjunction with their mission time. Further information can be found in the VDMA specification 66413 (universal database) [10]. 18 Conclusion The fourth edition of EN ISO 13849-1 is the result of a thorough overhaul of the standard. A clearer structure has been created on the basis of proven concepts, and further application aids have been added. Although the number of pages has increased substantially as a result, so has its ease of use. The IFA’s known application aids for EN ISO 13849 are gradually being adapted to the changes in the standard and are being made available at www.dguv.de/ifa/13849e. The SISTEMA software wizard will contain all the changes in version 3.0, and the IFA Reports 2/2017 and 4/2018, including the circuit examples, will also gradually be updated to reflect the new version of the standard.
