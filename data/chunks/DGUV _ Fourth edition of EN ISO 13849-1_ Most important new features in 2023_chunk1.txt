Fourth edition of EN ISO 13849-1 Most important new features in 2023 at a glance Overview The International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) has published a new version of the basic safety standard for machine controls, ISO 13849-1 “Safety of machinery – Safety-related parts of control systems – Part 1: General principles for design” [1]. A quarter of a century after the first publication of this standard, this is now a completely revised and modernised version. There is still quite some time before the EU Standard EN 13849-1 is harmonised, before the transitional three-year period has been completed and before the new version becomes binding. Yet it is nevertheless worth taking an early glimpse at its new features. Whereas the changes in the third edition of 2015 were merely editorial, to improve readability and usability, the latest update contains a range of more substantial adjustments and additions. For instance, the core sections “Design considerations”, “Safety functions” and “Categories”, which had grown and been supplemented since 1997, were systematically reorganised in order to map – after an “Overview” – first the “Specification of safety functions” and then the design process. Also, the role of subsystems within a safety chain has now been defined in more detail – especially concerning the integration of subsystems that have been given safety integrity levels (SILs) under IEC standards (IEC: International Electrotechnical Commission) on functional safety. The final design stage of validation, which was previously included in part 2 of the standard, has now been placed in part 1 as section 10 – largely unchanged in terms of content – so as to clearly emphasise its importance in the context of safety-oriented design. Further important improvements are the more detailed presentation of requirements for safety-related software and the newly included strategies for the practical implementation of electromagnetic
