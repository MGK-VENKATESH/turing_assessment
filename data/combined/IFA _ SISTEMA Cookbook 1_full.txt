For this purpose, the safety functions required for risk reduction are defined as part of the risk assessment conducted during design of the machine and then implemented by means of a suitable control system. The safety-related parts of machine controls can be implemented in accordance with EN ISO 13849-1. Included in the requirements of this stan- dard is the necessity
The test channel G2- K1-Q1 thus detects faults in B0 and T1/G1 and brings about the safe state; Category 2 is thus met. Note: Reasonable fault detection is also a requirement for Categories 3 and 4. Conversely, Category 2 subsystems lack a redundant functional channel. SISTEMA Cookbook (Version 1.0) - 13 - 3 From the schematic circuit diagram to the safety-related block diagram Step 6a: Adding the test channel of the block The components of the test channel which detect failure of the block and bring about the safe state are presented in the safety-related block diagram as test blocks as shown in Table 1 (Category 2) If components are entered in the test channel, a major basic criterion for Category 2 is met: the safety function must be tested at suitable intervals. This causes the loss of the safety function to be detected and a safe state to be brought about by an independent disconnect- ing device. A further important requirement for Category 2 is the test frequency (see BGIA Report 2/2008e, Section 6.25). However this is not relevant to the structural analysis. Step 7: Is the component "well-tried"? Redundancy or testing was not found in the example. Only Category 1 or Category B are therefore possible. Should the component in the block under analysis be a "well-tried" com- ponent to EN ISO 13849, the block is presented as part of a Category 1 subsystem. A list of well-tried components can be found in EN ISO 13849-2. If not, the block is part of a Category B subsystem. Step 8: Have all blocks been analysed? If further blocks still await analysis following assignment of the block to a subsystem, the pro- cedure on the diagram is repeated with the next block, beginning at Step 2a. The procedure otherwise continues
at Step 9. Step 9: Grouping blocks of the same category Subsystems of the same category can be merged by the grouping of components of identical channels (see BGIA Report 2/2008, Figure 6.14). Each component occurs only once within a channel; duplicates can be removed. The same component clearly cannot be used simulta- neously in two redundant functional channels. In Category 2, only components which share the same test channel can be grouped in a functional channel. Since SISTEMA limits MTTF values of each channel within the subsystems (capping), d grouping may result in a lower probability of a dangerous failure per hour being calculated. The lower probability of failure (PFH) is an advantage. A disadvantage however is that the grouped representation often makes it more difficult to follow the logical sequence of signal processing. The examples in Chapter 2 yield the safety-related block diagrams in Figure 5a: Figure 5a: Result of the structural analysis for the examples from Chapter 2 The safety function is now presented logically on the safety-related block diagram. In the next chapter, the probability of failure (PFH) is calculated with the aid of SISTEMA.

Of these, Category 2 (functional channel and test channel) and Categories 3 and 4 (two functional channels in each case) are affected. Entry is made in the subsystem (1.) under "CCF" (2.) by selection of the measures to be taken (Figure 16). At least 65 points must be reached. The number of points reached can be entered directly or compiled by a library of measures (3. and 4.). 22.. 11.. 33.. 44..

When the Category of a subsystem is selected, SISTEMA creates the relevant channels (CH). Under "Channel", the blocks (BL ) are added corre- sponding to the individual components of a channel. If no further subdivision of the blocks is required, the procedure can continue with 4.6.3. If a block is to be further subdivided into elements (always necessary with components for which the B is stated), the following set- 10d tings are required: a) In block (1.) under "MTTF " (2.), select "Determine MTTF -value from elements" (3.) d d (Figure 17). 22.. 33..

If all dangerous component faults can be excluded, a fault exclusion can also be selected when "Enter MTTF -value directly" is selected. d 4.6.3.2 DC For Category 2 and higher, fault-detection measures for the components are required. In the block or element (1.), a
percentage is entered on the "DC" tab (2.) for each component to describe the diagnostic coverage of fault detection. Selection of "DC-rating by choosing measures" enables the DC tables in EN ISO 13849-1, Annex E to be accessed via "Library" (3.). The values can be accepted as-is or used for guidance.Where the standard proposes a band of possible DC values, a concrete value within this band can be selected (Figure 22). 22.. 11.. 33..

If none are present, the PFH can be calculated (Figure 23). Figure 23 The result of the calculation is indicated at the bottom left for the selected safety function and the corresponding subsystems, blocks and elements (Figure 24). The (attained) PL of the safety function must at least equal the (required) PL. If the attained PL is insufficient, r components with a higher MTTF or a higher B value must be employed, the fault detection d 10d (DC) must be improved, or subsystems of other Categories must be implemented.

for the machine design engineer to calculate the probability of a dan- gerous failure per hour (PFH) in order to determine the Performance Level (PL). The Per- formance Level is dependent upon the control system's structure (Category), as well as the systematic requirements. For this purpose, the IFA provides the SISTEMA software tool (the German acronym stands for "safety of controls on machines”), which can be downloaded free of charge from www.dguv.de/ifa, Webcode e34183. Before beginning the calculations, the machine design engineer must produce a safety- related block diagram for each safety function from the circuit diagram. The safety-related block diagram must show the implementation of the safety function in functional channels (including redundant channels, where present) and testing components, also where present. The SISTEMA Cookbook 1 addresses this unfamiliar and difficult abstraction step (Figure 1) and the subsequent step, that of transferring the blocks to SISTEMA and entering their pa- rameters.

A precise definition of the safety function (see BGIA Report 2/2008, Chapter 5) is therefore indispensable for the subsequent steps.

the safety function in a functional channel (redundant structures possess two functional channels). They also include all test facilities responsible for detecting such dangerous failures and bringing about a safe state. A sche- matic circuit diagram shows for example the electrical circuitry of position switches, pro- grammable logic controllers (PLCs) and contactors, and the flow of current from the sensor, via signal processing, to the actuator. Example 1 (Figure 2) shows an implementation of the safety function for "opening of the movable guard initiates the safe torque off (STO) safety function". All other components which are purely functional and have no influence upon the safety function have already been omitted. Figure 2: Schematic circuit diagram showing relevant components (Example 1); see BGIA Report 2/2008e, Chapter 8.2.18 SISTEMA Cookbook (Version 1.0) - 6 - 2 Schematic circuit diagram showing functional and test channels 2.2 Entering the function and test channels The functional channels are first marked on the schematic circuit diagram. It has been found effective in practice to "work backwards", i.e. to begin at the actuator end and follow the channel back to the sensor. This yields the signal paths from the triggering event to the response of the safety function (Figure 3). Figure 3: Schematic circuit diagram with two redundant functional channels, B1-Q2 and B2-K1-Q1 (Example 1) Where circuits employ a test channel with a dedicated disconnecting device (Category 2), this test channel is also marked on the schematic circuit diagram. Figure 4 shows the exam- ple of a protective device fitted at the intake of a roller; when the device is tripped, the motor is stopped within 1/3 of a rotation. In this example, the angle of rotation required for the motor to come to a stop is tested regularly by manual actuation of the protective device. SISTEMA

SISTEMA Cookbook (Version 1.0) - 8 - 3 From the schematic circuit diagram to the safety-related block diagram 3 From the schematic circuit diagram to the safety-related block diagram In the next step, the schematic circuit diagram is transformed for each safety function into the logical representation of the safety-related block diagram. In the course of the transformation, the components of the schematic circuit diagram are assigned to "subsystems" with which the safety function is modelled in SISTEMA. In the presentation as a safety-related block diagram the logical interrelationships are rele- vant rather than the physical connections between the components. Each component within a safety function is a constituent part of a certain structure. This structure is termed a "Cate- gory" in EN ISO 13849-1, and grouped within SISTEMA as a subsystem. The sequences of subsystems with their corresponding Categories are represented by a safety function in the form of a safety-related block diagram. The sequence of the subsystems has no bearing upon subsequent calculation of the probability of failure. 3.1 Categories to EN ISO 13849-1 The Categories to EN ISO 13849-1, their characterizing features and their typical representa- tion are shown in Table 1. Table 1: Features and representation of the Categories Structure Category to EN ISO 13849-1 and Typical representation in the particular features safety-related block diagram Single-channel Category B (basic category) Single-channel Category 1 (use of well-tried com- ponents) Single-channel, Category 2 (component faults in the tested functional channel (X3) are

Encapsulated subsystems constitute a particular case. Encapsulated subsystems are com- ponents for which the manufacturer himself states the PL, PFH and Category (e.g. safety PLC, safety modules); see Table 2.

Note: This section is only concerned with determining the structure. Additional requirements beyond this apply to all Categories: for example, components must be designed, fabricated, selected, assembled and combined in compliance with the relevant stan- dards in such a way that they are able to withstand the anticipated ambient condi- tions. Essential safety principles
must be applied. In Categories 1, 2, 3 and 4, safety principles which are well-tried must also be applied. Information on these aspects can be found in EN ISO 13849-2. Quantitative requirements the observance of which is checked by SISTEMA also apply to the Categories. The procedure described here is geared to the application of EN ISO 13849-1 and its "desig- nated architectures" for the Categories. If modelling to one of the categories is not possible, even when additional components or channels are omitted, the simplified method described in the standard cannot be applied. In this case, the probability of failure must be verified with recourse to other methods, such as Markov modelling, as described in EN 61508-6, Annex B. SISTEMA Cookbook (Version 1.0) - 10 - 3 From the schematic circuit diagram to the safety-related block diagram Procedure for structural analysis: The starting-point for the structural analysis is the schematic circuit diagram on which the function and test channels are marked. The procedure is shown schematically in Annex E. Figure 5 contains the same procedure, together with its application to Examples 1 and 2 shown in Chapter 2. Step 1: Formation of a sequence of the components in a functional channel All components along the first functional channel (that with the fewest components) are writ- ten as blocks from left to right (from the sensor to the actuator). Step 2: Considering the first block Each individual block of the first functional channel is now assigned in turn to subsystems of the relevant Category, according to the characteristic features of the Categories. Step 3: Does the component manufacturer state the PL and PFH (and Category)? An encapsulated subsystem can be recognized as such by the fact that it is already charac- terized by the manufacturer by a PL (or SIL
in accordance with IEC standards), PFH and Category (internal structure). The internal structure of the encapsulated subsystem need not be deconstructed further. Note: If a Category 3 or 4 encapsulated subsystem occupies in both redundant functional channels, both functional channels pass through it. Step 4: Can all component faults be excluded? All assumed faults for the component in the block under analysis are considered in turn. For this purpose, the annex of EN ISO 13849-2 contains the fault models of a number of compo- nents used in machine controls. Owing to justified fault exclusions, certain component faults can be discounted. For each fault case, it must be considered whether the intended safety- related functionality of the component is retained (harmless fault) or fails (dangerous fault). A dangerous fault exists for example for contactor Q2 in Example 1 (Figure 3) when the safety door is opened but Q2 fails to drop out because its contacts have welded. Should no dangerous faults whatsoever need to be assumed for the component, no value exists for calculation of the PFH of the safety function. It need not be considered in the safety-related block diagram. Further presentation of the safety function can however be constructive, since it may be conducive to an understanding of it. In this case, the block is treated as an encapsulated subsystem ("fault exclusion" is then subsequently ticked in SISTEMA, and further entries are not required). Step 5: Is the safety function retained in the event of component faults? The dangerous faults to be assumed for the component in the block under analysis are determined in Step 4. Their effects upon the safety function are now considered.

analysis with reference to the examples from Chapter 2: SF = safety function SISTEMA Cookbook (Version 1.0) - 12 - 3 From the schematic circuit diagram to the safety-related block diagram Step 5a: Adding the redundant functional channel of the block(s) If the safety function is maintained by one or more redundant components in the event of a fault in the block under analysis (i.e. a second functional channel is present), these compo- nents are presented as blocks in a second functional channel (refer to the example in Table 1: Categories 3 and 4). In Example 1 (Figure 3), this applies to both B1 and Q2. The redundant functional channel B2-K1-Q1 is therefore added to both blocks. Note: The components of the redundant functional channel are thus used several times. This is a result of the phased procedure and should not be a hindrance at this stage. Blocks of which multiple instances exist are grouped together again in Step 8. If redundant components have been entered, a major basic criterion for Categories 3 and 4 has been met. A single fault in a component of the first or second functional channel must not result in loss of the safety function (single-fault tolerance). Note: In addition, Category 3 requires that, wherever reasonably possible, individual faults in components within the two functional channels should be detected. Step 5b: Is the safety function retained in the event of an accumulation of undetected faults? For the block under analysis here and its redundant functional channel, single-fault tolerance has been identified up to this point and Category 3 is satisfied. Are the criteria for Category 4 also met? For this purpose, the behaviour in the event of undetected faults occurring must be studied. If the safety function is retained in the event of an accumulation
of two undetected faults, the subsystem satisfies Category 4. If the safety function is not retained at the second undetected fault, the subsystem satisfies Category 3. In Example 1 (Figure 3), PLC K1 could actuate outputs O1.0 and O1.1 continuously in the event of a fault. Q1 would be continually energized in this case. Even if the PLC were able to detect this fault by reading back of the monitoring contacts, it would not be able to bring about the safe state. Should a second fault then cause the contacts of Q2 to weld, the motor would continue to run even with the protective equipment open; the safety function has failed, and Category 4 is not met. Note: In Category 4, single-fault tolerance must be satisfied and the discrete fault in a com- ponent in the first or second functional channel must be detected at or before the next demand upon the safety function. If detection in this way is not possible, an accumu- lation of two undetected faults must not lead to loss of the safety function. Step 6: Are component faults detected? At this point, it is clear that there is no redundancy and that consequently neither Category 3 nor Category 4 is met. If failure of a block in a test channel is detected by a test channel and the safe state is brought about, the subsystem satisfies Category 2. In Example 2 (Figure 4), tripping of B0 causes controlled stopping of the motor by T1/G1 within 1/3 of a rotation. Testing is in response to a demand by K1 prompted by manual actua- tion of B0 and measurement of the stopping angle by K1/G2. In the event of a fault, the safe state is brought about via Q1. The test detects faults in B0 and T1/G1.
