Basic conditions| Machine safety 17 Further parameters to determine Emerson can performance levels provide assistance! Before a final answer about the performance of a safety function can be given, MTTF , DC, and CCF must be defined. D Mean time to dangerous failure (MTTF ) D Assessment MTTF MTTF describes the mean duration in years until a D D Low 3 years ≤ MTTF < 10 years dangerous system component failure. D Medium 10 years ≤ MTTF < 30 years It is a statistical value for electrical/electronic D components, which is identified through trials or High 30 years ≤ MTTF D < 100 years (resp. < 2.500 years in Cat. 4) reliability prognoses based on failure probabilities for the components. c Source: ISO 13849 Formula for determining B MTTF = 10D MTTF D for a mechanical D 0,1 • n element in a channel: op B = B x 2 as recommended by IFA 10D 10 Mean n (actuations/year) op d • h • 3600s/h for the mechanical element: n = op op op t cycle d = day, h = hours, s = second Calculating the total MTTF 1 D for two different channels: 2 1 1 MTTF = MTTF + MTTF - + D 3 DC1 DC2 MTTF MTTF DC1 DC2 For our 2-channel example and taking into account the following operating data, for channel 1 this means: 220 d, 16 h/d, T = 10 s -> n = 1.267.200 cycles/year and a B value for the CD07 5/3 directional valve of 24.8
million switching op 10 cycles results in an MTTF value of 391.41 years; D For channel 2 with the following operating data: 220 d/a, 16 h/d, T = 3.600 s -> n = 3.520 cycles/year and a B value for the CD04 directional valve of 32 million switching cycles as op 10 well as a B value of 2 million switching cycles for the LU6 locking unit results in an MTTF value of 181.818 years for the valve and 10D D 5.682 years for the locking unit. Both channels therefore have a high MTTF value. D 18 Machine safety | Basic conditions Identification of the MTTF using the value B – example D 10 for lifecycle duration The value B specifies the number of cycles until 10% 10 of components tested in endurance trials (acc. to DIN EN ISO 19973) have exceeded the defined limits. B 10 describes a statistical failure probability. It is an indicator for the reliability of a wearing part, evaluating the number of switching cycles for pneumatic valves, for example. In terms of machine safety, ISO 13849-1 only considers dangerous machine failures. These are described by B . 10D Assuming that half of all failures are dangerous, we would apply the formula B = 2 x B . B is required for all 10D 10 10D safety-related components in a control that are susceptible to wear and for all components directly involved in a safety function. The value for B is used to calculate MTTF (see 10D D page 19). Emerson provides extensive proof of reliability for its products in order to calculate performance levels. This data can also be found in our SISTEMA libraries. c SISTEMA c Proof from Emerson Basic conditions| Machine safety 19 DC – Emerson can provide assistance! diagnostic coverage When a
dangerous failure does occur, despite all application. The possibility of excluding a failure also depends on preventive measures, test equipment (diagnostics the application. or monitoring system) can detect it at an early This decision is therefore not usually made by the component stage to return the machine to a safe state. DC values are classified as follows: Depending on the required performance level, Designation DC range there are requirements for the DC or diagnostic coverage value, i.e. the coverage which must be None DC < 60 % provided by testing equipment. Low 60 % ≤ DC < 90 % The performance level therefore includes the Medium 90 % ≤ DC < 99 % High 99 % ≤ DC Diagnostic options for pneumatics c Four DC classes in the simplified approach from ISO 13849-1 Plausibility check manufacturer. Cylinder switch Annex E of ISO 13849-1 provides a simplified approach to Position measuring system estimating DC values. The engineer analyzes and evaluates the switching and the sequence of machine processes to estimate the percentage of errors that can be discovered by these measures. G G G Typical errors for safety-related parts of control systems are P P Pressure listed in ISO 13849-2. A typical error that could occur with sensor directional valves is failure to lock, for example. Diagnosis occurs SPS Flow meter indirectly via the sensor at the cylinder; here, a diagnostic coverage level of 90% can be assumed. For the locking unit, a typical error might be “Failing to clamp although control input is Switching position vented”. Diagnosis is performed in this case directly by the sensor sensing 4 2 at the locking unit. For this component, diagnostic coverage 14 Switching of 99% can be assumed.

More specifically: valves that control potentially hazardous movements or system states. Required safety functions can usually be achieved by other linked controls with the appropriate valve versions or even by additional mechanical solutions such as holding devices or brakes. Drive elements as well as energy conversion and transfer components in fluid power systems are usually beyond the scope of the standard. In pneumatic systems, components must be protected against hazards associated with energy changes. Moreover, the air preparation unit used to process compressed air must be safely connected to the valve area. To reliably control possible energy changes, an exhaust valve is often used in conjunction with a pressure switch. 1A Drive elements Components that perform Relevant section safety-related function, e.g. valves for safety-related control component Components that guard against energy fluctuations OZ Potentially OZ11 OV11 OZ10 relevant for compliance with basic and well-tried OV10 “Air preparation unit”

Redundant safe exhaust is guaranteed via two exhaust pathways: • Via non-return valves 2V2 and 2V3 and the directional valve 2V1. The minimum opening pressure of the non-return valves must be taken into account. • Via directional valve 1V1 Cylinder extension and retraction is only possible with the combined actuation of 1V1 and 2V1.

The directional valves comply with the quiescent current principle and have sufficient positive overlap. The non- return valves must be engineered to assume an open state, even with failure, to safely exhaust the cylinder chambers.

In the basic valve position, the pressure in the cylinder is chambered; the cylinder stops when forces are balanced.

2006/42/EC (EU Machinery Regulation EU 2023/1230 starting from January 20th, 2027) on machine engineering aims to ensure a common safety level for new machines distributed and operated in the member states. It governs safety and occupational health requirements for design and engineering. The CE mark indicates that the manufacturer has achieved an adequate level of protection. Harmonized standards from the European standards organizations provide additional assistance to machine operators and manufacturers, since they enhance compliance with the Machinery Directive (EU Machinery Regulation EU 2023/1230 starting from January 20th, 2027) through what is called “presumption of conformity”. This principle, however, only applies to the legal requirements that the harmonized standards actually cover. Almost all laws worldwide mandate a risk assessment to analyze and assess risks and finally implement mitigating measures.

Safe exhaust and reversing – the dual valve for twice the safety. Standard-compliant safety with minimal response times Series SV dual valves are redundant 3/2 or 5/2 directional valves with direct monitoring that meet requirements to protect against unexpected start-up, as well as safe exhaust (3/2 directional valve) and save reversing (5/2 directional valve) in pneumatic safety controls. The 3/2 dual valves only activate the compressed air supply when all conditions for a safe system start-up have been met, preventing potential accidents. In the event of a machine fault or emergency OFF, the valve exhausts the operating lines, ensuring a de-energized and thus safe state.

assess – eliminate The risk assessment process provides the basis for machine safety (see figure on pages 6, 7). The machine manufacturer starts with a risk analysis, minimizes identified risks, and finally determines whether an adequate level of safety is present. If the answer is negative, risk reduction measures must be implemented and quantified in terms of effectiveness. Let’s take a look at some basic terms defined in ISO 12100, which provides a general description of the risk assessment process: Hazards: Potential sources of harm Hazardous situation: Situation in which a person is exposed to at least one hazard. The resulting harm can be immediate or occur over time. Risk: Results from a hazard and is assessed by combining the likelihood of the occurrence of harm and the severity of consequence. c Dangerous c Hot surface electrical voltage c Keep hands clear c Entanglement rotating parts c Risk of entrapment c Cutting hazard c Head injury hazard Basic conditions| Machine safety 5 Towards safe machinery: Risk assessment Globally, and almost without exception, statutory guidelines for the design and operation of machines mandate a risk assessment to identify potential hazards, minimize risks, and comply with applicable health and safety requirements. The process helps determine the type and quality of preventive measures or safeguards. Risk assessment • Provides an important body of proof for the • Must be performed by machine manufacturer for liability claims in accident manufacturer; results remain with the cases manufacturer • Must account for both proper use and any foreseeable misuse of the machine Start Identify limits of machinery Identify hazards Estimate risk Design-related safety measures No E.g. inherent safety Safe machine?

Within the risk assessment process, we focus on implementing technical measures to mitigate risk, evaluating the safety function, and determining the performance level. The graphic below shows the risk assessment process – this guide uses examples to take you through the individual steps until the performance level is achieved. The performance level (PL) must meet or exceed the required performance level (PL). This depends on factors such as the r control architecture (category), the mean time to dangerous failure (MTTF ), diagnostic coverage (DC), D and common cause failure (CCF). Select safety function Define safety function features Determine PL r Design and technical implementation of safety function Define PL PL ≥ PL Category MTTF DC CCF D r | Machine safety 7 For all safety functions! Basic conditions Risk assessment: Risk analysis Risk assessment comprises three areas: risk analysis, risk evaluation, and risk reduction. The actual risk analysis starts with defining the limits of a machine when considering all phases of its lifecycle. Once all hazards have been identified, the risk of each hazard must be estimated. Risk analysis: machine limits In addition to spatial limits and the overall duration of use, operating limits are a prime focus. Proper use is analyzed, including all operating modes and different intervention options, as well as reasonably foreseeable misuse. For risk analysis, it is necessary to consider the entire machine lifecycle, from transport to installation, commissioning and cleaning, disassembly and, finally, disposal.

Standard EN ISO 12100-1 specifies all relevant potential hazards in production that may result in injury to people or animals, or damage to property. Hazards are divided into different categories, as shown in the diagram below. Our focus is especially geared toward safe machine shut-down, safe valve exhaust, and safe pressure release in pneumatic systems and components – precisely because these mechanical hazards can result in personal injury. Radiation hazard: Radiation: frequency, radiation: light, X-ray and gamma rays … Mechanical hazards: Crushing, clipping, cutting or shearing, catching or wrapping, pulling in or trapping, impact, Substances, materials: puncture, abrasion, fluids under pressure Contact or inhalation of dangerous substances, fire, explosion, virus, bacteria Electrical hazards: Direct or indirect contact, high voltage, Ergonomics: electrostatic processes, thermal radiation Posture, exertion, anatomy, protective or particles Hazards acc. to equipment, lighting, stress, insufficient challenges, human behavior, actuators, Thermal hazards: EN ISO 12100 visual indicators, displays Burns, frostbite Combination Noise hazards: of hazards Loss of hearing, disequilibrium, disturbance in speech Vibration-related hazards: Tripping, slipping, Vibration: handheld tools, falling hazards full-body vibration Basic conditions| Machine safety 9 Risk analysis: Risk estimation – Performance level Risk reduction measures are derived based on the severity of possible injury, the frequency of the hazard, and the probability of its occurrence. Performance level is a technical target: it conveys the effort required to reduce risk at a machine. The target must be met as a minimum requirement. Every safety function has a required safety level. This is described by the required performance level, PLr for short, which is defined based on the following criteria from ISO 13849-1: S Severity
of injury Risk estimation S1 Minor (normally temporary injury) • Manufacturers are free to apply their own process or that specified in a standard such as ISO 13849-1 or IEC 62061. S2 Serious (normally permanent injury, including death) F Frequency and/or duration of exposure Low risk F1 Rare to infrequent and/or brief F2 Frequent to continuous and/or long ISO 13849-1 P Possibility of avoiding hazard P1 Possible under certain conditions P1 P2 Scarcely possible PL a F1 P2 S1 P1 PL b F2 P2 P1 PL c F1 PL is distinguished based on letters from a (minimal P2 r S2 action required) to e (extensive action required). PL d P1 F2 P2 PL e High risk S Severity of injury F Frequency and/or length of exposure P Possibility of avoiding hazard or limiting harm 10 Machine safety | Basic conditions Risk assessment: Risk evaluation During a risk analysis, should you conclude that risk reduction is required, you will need to adopt corresponding preventive measures to achieve an adequate safety level. The best solution is an inherently safe design. Instructional measures such as user information harbor the risk of non-compliance and are thus only permissible as supplement once all technical options to improve safety have been exhausted. Technical measures present an additional route. Preventive technical measures If a machine’s safety depends on a properly functioning control, this can be termed “functional safety”. The “active” parts of the control are the main focus, i.e. components that detect a dangerous situation (signal recording, “I” = input), derive suitable reactions (evaluation, “L” = logic), and implement reliable measures (execution, “O” = output). The term “control” thus refers to the entire signal processing system. Note: “Safety-related parts of control systems” are not necessarily “safety components” as defined by the Machinery Directive. SRP/CS (Safety Related Parts
of a Control System) can, however, be such safety components, e.g. two-hand controls or logic units with safety function. Actuators (cylinders), energy supply (e.g. pressure supply or air preparation units) and connections are not directly factored into dangerous failure rates. ISO 13849 is the generic standard for safety components in controls.

After a prior risk estimation and the movements). definition of the required performance level (PL), the necessary degree of risk reduction is r determined. The following parameters determine whether the safety function actually mitigates risk to the required extent: • Control architecture (category) • Mean time to dangerous failure (MTTF ) D • Diagnostic coverage (DC) • Common cause failure (CCF) As a general rule: The performance level PL must at least correspond to the required PL. r
