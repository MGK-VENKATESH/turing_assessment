measures) Sensors for monitoring machine parameters The risk assessment may show that certain machine param- eters shall be monitored and detected during operation. Safe position monitoring Safety-related sensors or position switches can be used to pre- vent a machine overrunning or leaving a specific position (g 3-5). Electro-sensitive safety inductive position switches are par- ticularly suitable for this task. They monitor a certain part of the process (e.g., robot’s axis or a moving part of a machine) for presence without the need for a specific mating element, without wear, and with a high enclosure rating. 3 Safe position monitoring for a lift on an automobile production line c Monitoring of rotation, speed, overrun Encoders or travel measurement systems are used to detect and evaluate rotation, speed, and overrun. The signals from encoders can be used in automated guided vehicles to adapt the protective field size of safety laser scan- ners to the speed at which the vehicles are moving. Safe standstill or rotation evaluation modules monitor the movement of drives using sensors or rotary encoders to generate a safe control signal at standstill or on deviation from preset parameters. If safety-related requirements are more stringent, either safety encoders or redundant encoders shall be used. Another possibility is to monitor the voltage induced by residual magnetism on a motor that is spinning down.

travel- ing speed is generally used to determine the minimum distance and not the approach speed of people. When the vehicle (and therefore the protective device) and a person are approaching each other, under normal circumstances it is assumed the per- son will recognize the danger and stop or move away. Therefore, the minimum distance only needs to be set to a length that is sufficient to stop the vehicle safely. Safety supplements may be necessary dependent on the ap- plication and the technology used.

To detect systematic failures, a thorough systematic check should be made by some- one other than the designer and thus the principle of counter- checking by a second person applied. A possible way of implementing this specification is what is known as the design matrix. Here, certain combinations of safety-related input signals for specific cases (e.g., “position lost,” or “robot left”) are combined. These cases shall act on the machine functions via the safety-related outputs in ac- cordance with the requirements of the safety function. This method is also used by SICK during the design of application software. A review with all those involved in the project is sensible. In the case of programs that are poorly documented and unstructured, faults occur during subsequent modifications; in particular, there is a danger of unknown dependencies or side Case effects, as they are often referred to. Good specifications and program documentation are very effective in

Safeguarding (technical protective measures) Risk reduction Power control elements The safety function initiated by the protective devices and the logic unit shall stop hazardous machine functions. For this purpose, § the actuator elements or work elements are switched off by power control elements. - Principle of switch off/power shutdown: ISO 13849-2 (B-type standard) Contactors N/C Electromechanical contactors are the most commonly used type of power control element. One or more contactors can ≥0.5 mm 1 form a safety function subsystem by combining special selec- N/O tion criteria, wiring, and technical measures. By protecting the contacts against overcurrent and short-circuits, over-sizing (normally by a factor of 2), and other measures, a contac- tor is considered a proven component. To be able to perform diagnostics on contactors for safety functions, unambiguous 2 feedback of the output state is necessary, known as “external device monitoring” (EDM). This requirement can be met using a contactor with positively guided contacts. The contacts are ≥0.5 mm N/C positively guided when all contacts within a set are mechani- cally linked in such a way that normally open contacts and 3 normally closed contacts can never be closed simultaneously at any point during the intended mission time. c The term “positively guided contacts” refers primarily to N/O auxiliary contactors and auxiliary contacts. A defined distance between the contacts of at least 0.5 mm at the normally closed contact must be ensured even in the event of a fault (welded N/O contact). As with contactors with low switching capacity (< 4 kW), there is
essentially no difference between the main contact elements and the auxiliary contact elements. It is also possible to use the term “positively guided contacts” to refer to those small contactors. On larger contactors, what are known as “mirror contacts” are used: While any main contact on a contactor is closed, no mirror contact (auxiliary normally closed contact) is allowed to be closed. A typical application for mirror contacts is the highly reliable monitoring of the output state of a contactor in control circuits on machines. 3-70 GUIDE FOR SAFE MACHINERY | SICK 7028282/2014-09-08 Subject to change without notice GA relleoM :ecruoS Contact system of a contactor with positively guided contacts.

However, fault exclusion in the event of the springs breaking is not possible. 3 An important differentiating factor between the valves is the c design of the moving switching element inside the valve. The failure mode for each valve is essentially determined by its design. Poppet valves might leak, but in piston valves, the piston slide might jam. With a poppet valve, the switching function is affected by the moving switching element (valve plate), which changes position relative a seat inside the housing. This design enables large cross-sections to be released with short strokes. The risk of leaks can be excluded with an appropriate design.

Machine users expect to be offered only safe machinery or devices. This expectation exists worldwide. There are also regulations on the protection of operators of machinery worldwide. These regulations are subject to regional variations. However, there is broad agreement on the process to be applied during the manufacture and upgrade of machinery. • During the design and manufacture of machinery, the machine manufacturer shall identify and evaluate all possible hazards and hazardous points by under- taking a risk assessment (formerly also called a hazard analysis). • Based on this risk assessment, the supplier and user should take suitable design measures to eliminate or reduce the risk. If the risk cannot be eliminated by these design measures or the remaining risk cannot be tolerated, the supplier and user shall define, select, and apply suitable engineering controls. If the remain- ing risk is not acceptable, administrative controls such as organizational proce- dures should be implemented. Information on the residual risks should also be provided. • To ensure the intended measures work correctly, overall validation is necessary. This overall validation shall evaluate the design and technical measures, as well as the organizational measures in context. We can guide you to safe machinery in 6 steps. The procedure is outlined on the previous page. About this guide What does the guide contain? Who is this guide for? In front of
technical documentation file for the machine; in particular, this shall include all safety­related design documents. • You shall supply operating instructions with the product in the official language of the country of use. The original version is also to be supplied with the product. • You shall complete a declaration of conformity and mark the machine or the safety component with the CE mark. §§--88 GUIDE FOR SAFE MACHINERY | SICK 7028282/2014-09-08 Subject to change without notice Laws, regulations, directives, standards Standards Laws, regulations, directives, standards Standards Standards This Guide essentially references the most prominent national standards in the Americas.

Placing on the market Making available for the first time in the European Community machinery or partly - 6-3 completed machinery with a view to distribution or use, whether for reward or free of charge (Machinery Directive 2006-42-EC) Positive opening Positive opening on switches signifies that there must be positive transmission of - 3-23 force between actuator and switching element. The actuating mechanism must be designed so that even in the event of mechanical failure (a spring fracturing or contact welding, for example) the contacts open reliably and remain open in the actuated state (IEC 60947-5-1/EN 60947-5-1). Presence detection Secondary protective device for machines and/or systems that can be accessed - 3-48 from the floor and on which the system must be prevented from starting while the operator is inside (safety function: preventing start). Protective field The area in which the test object specified by the manufacturer is detected by the - 3-30 electro-sensitive protective equipment (g ESPE). • Safety light curtain: The protective field lies between the sender unit and the receiver unit. It is defined by the protective field height and the protective field width. • Safety laser scanner: The protective field secures the hazard zone on a ma- chine or vehicle. The field is defined by the scanning range, scanning angle, response time, and resolution of the device used (see technical specifications). PSDI Presence–Sensing Device Operating mode of indirect manual initiation of a single cycle by a presence–sens- - 3-38 Initiation ing device when it
senses that work motions of the operator related to feeding or removing parts are completed and all parts of the operator’s body are withdrawn from the sensing field of the device (ANSI B11.19). R Reset Resetting the protective device to the monitored status. - 3-43 • Manual reset is provided by a separate device to be operated manually, e.g., - 3-64 using a reset button. • Automatic reset by the protective device is only permitted in exceptional cases: It must not be possible for persons to be in the hazard zone without the protec- tive device triggering or it must be ensured there are no people in the hazard zone during and after reset. Resolution/Sensor detection capability The limit for the sensor parameter that causes the electro-sensitive protective - 3-30 equipment (g ESPE) to respond. It is defined by the manufacturer. Response time The maximum time between the occurrence of an event which activates the sen- - 3-44 sor unit and the switching outputs (g OSSDs) being switched to the OFF state. Restart Putting the machine back into operation. After the triggering of the protective - 3-64 function or after a fault, the protective device can be reset to make it possible to subsequently restart the machine. Restart interlock Means of preventing automatic restarting of a machine following triggering of the - 3-55 safety function during a dangerous part of the machine operating cycle, after a change in the operating mode of the machine, and after a change to the device used to control starting of the machine (IEC 61496-1/EN 61496-1). • Operating modes include: inching, single stroke, automatic • Startup control devices include: foot switch, two-hand control device, single- break PSDI triggering or double-break PSDI triggering by the ESPE’s sensor i function • Restart interlock (RES): The machine stops
and the restart interlock (RES) is engaged on interruption of at least one light beam. This interlock ensures that the machine can only be restarted if the light path is clear and the reset button has been pressed and released again. S Safety function Function of a machine whose failure can result in an immediate increase of the - 3-2 risk(s) (ISO 12100). A safety function is provided by safety-related parts of control systems (g SRP/CS). Sensor detection capability/Resolution The limit for the sensor parameter that causes the electro-sensitive protective - 3-30 equipment (g ESPE) to respond. It is defined by the manufacturer. i-16 GUIDE FOR SAFE MACHINERY | SICK 7028282/2014-09-08 SSuubbjjeecctt ttoo cchhaannggee wwiitthhoouutt nnoottiiccee Annex Overview of relevant standards Abbreviation/Term Definition Index SFF Safe failure fraction Safe failures as a fraction of the overall failure rate of a subsystem that does not - 3-90 result in a dangerous failure (IEC 62061/EN 62061).

SILCL SIL claim limit Safety integrity level claim limit (for a subsystem): Maximum SIL that can be - 3-89 claimed for an g SRECS subsystem in relation to architectural constraints and systematic safety integrity (IEC 62061/EN 62061). Single-break/double-break PSDI mode: This operating mode is advantageous if parts must be inserted or removed by - 3-38 hand periodically. In this mode, the machine cycle is automatically re-initiated after the protective field becomes clear again following single or double break. The reset device must be activated under the following conditions: • When the machine starts • On
restart if the g AOPD is interrupted within a dangerous movement • To initiate a restart after more than 30 s has elapsed (see IEC 61496-1/ RIA TR R15.406, CSA Z432, EN 61496-1) g More information: EN 692 However, it is necessary to check that no hazard to the operator can arise during the work process. This limits use to small machines where the hazard zone can- not be accessed and presence detection is in place. Suitable measures must also be taken to protect all other sides of the machine. If this operating mode is activated, the resolution of the AOPD must be less than or equal to 30 mm (see ANSI B11.19, CSA Z432, ISO 13855, RIA TR R15.406, EN 692, and EN 693). As a general rule, when mounting protective devices, the following faults must be excluded: reaching over, reaching under, reaching around, standing behind.

In the past, protective devices in the work process were something of a nuisance; for this reason, they were often not used at all. Innovative technology has enabled protective devices to be integrated into the work process. As a result, they are no longer a hindrance for the operator; in fact, they often even help productivity. For this reason, reliable protective devices integrated into the workplace are essential these days. Safety is a basic need Safety is a basic human need.

Do not give your key to anyone. • Test equipment and circuitry to make sure they are de-energized. This must be done by a qualified person.* • Deplete stored energy by bleeding, blocking, grounding,
etc. • Apply a tag to alert other individuals that an energy source or piece of equipment has been locked out. • Make sure everyone is safe and accounted for before equipment and circuits are unlocked and turned back on. Note that only a qualified person* may determine when it is safe to re-energize circuits. *OSHA designates a “qualified person” as someone who has received mandated training on the hazards and on the construction and operation of equipment involved in a task. 2-10 GUIDE FOR SAFE MACHINERY | SICK 7028282/2014-09-08 Subject to change without notice Risk reduction Safe design Stop functions Along with the stopping of a machine during normal operation, Stop categories it shall also be possible to stop a machine in an emergency Safety-related and function-related aspects in machines result situation for safety reasons. in stop functions in various categories.

Examples: • Safety cover with special observation window on a milling machine for protection from flying chips and parts of work- pieces (see figure) 1 • Fence that can retain a robot arm 3 a Initiating a stop A safety-related stop function places the machine in a safe state on demand (e.g., approach of a person). To reduce the required stopping time, a stop function which complies with stop Category 1 (NFPA 79 and EN 60204-1 g 2-11) may be applied. Additional safety functions may be necessary to pre- vent unexpected start-up. Examples: • Opening a protective door with an interlock that has no lock- ing function • Interrupting the light beams on a multiple light beam safety device providing access protection (see figure) 7028282/2014-09-08 GUIDE FOR SAFE MACHINERY | SICK 3-3 Subject to change without notice Technical protective measures Risk reduction Avoiding unexpected startup After actuating the “initiating a stop” function or
switching the machine on, specific actions are required to put the machine into operation. These actions include manually resetting a pro- tective device to prepare for restarting the machine (see also section “Application of reset and restart”g 3-64). Examples: • Resetting the emergency stop device 1 • Resetting an optoelectronic protective device (see figure: Blue “Reset” button) • Restarting the machine once all the necessary protective devices are effective Preventing start 3 After an “initiating a stop” function, technical measures prevent the machine from starting or being put back into operation as a long as there are persons in the hazard zone. Examples: • Trapped key systems • Detection in the active protective field of a horizontal safety light curtain (see figure). The “initiating a stop” function is implemented by the protective field of the vertical safety light curtain. Combination of initiating a stop/preventing start Restart is prevented using the same protective device that initi- ates the stop as long as there are people or parts of the body detected in the hazard zone Examples: • A two-hand control on single-person workplaces • Use of a light curtain so that standing behind or reaching around is not possible (hazardous point protection) • Use of a safety laser scanner for area protection (see figure) 3-4 GUIDE FOR SAFE MACHINERY | SICK 7028282/2014-09-08 Subject to change without notice Risk reduction Technical protective measures Allowing material passage To move materials in or out of the hazard zone, specific features of the materials moved are used for material detection or to automatically differentiate between material and people.

In these instances, additional measures must be provided for risk reduction and may only be allowed if the follow conditions are met: • An operating mode selector switch capable of supervisory control (e.g., key switch) with a corresponding operating posi- 1 tion shall be used • Automatic control shall be disabled and there shall be no movement of the machine due to direct or indirect activation of sensors • No linked sequences shall be possible • Hazardous machine functions shall only be possible with hold-to-run controls (devices requiring sustained action, such as two-hand control or enabling devices) • Hazardous machine functions are only permitted under reduced risk conditions (e.g., limitation of speed, force, movement distance, duration of function) • All individuals exposed to the hazardous machine function 3 must be provided with and be in direct control of their own control device a Example: • Movement only at reduced speed with
enabling button engaged and +/- buttons actuated (see figure) Combining or switching safety functions A machine can adopt various states or work in various operat- ing modes. During this process, different safety measures may be effective or different safety functions coupled together. By means of control functions, it must be ensured that the required level of safety is always achieved. Switching between operating modes or the selection and adjustment of different safety measures shall not lead to a dangerous state. Examples: • After a change of operating mode between setup and nor- mal operation, the machine is stopped.

Dual-channel safety components are common in the machine safety sector (see figure below). Each channel can perform the intended safety function. The two channels can be of diverse design (e.g., one channel uses electromechanical components, the other only electronics). Instead of a second equivalent channel, the second channel can also have a pure monitoring function. Single-channel safety components Input Output I L O signal signal Dual-channel safety components Input Monitoring I1 L1 O1 signal Output signal ssorC nosirapmoc Reliability of the components/devices Any failure of a safety component will result in an interruption to the production process. For this reason, it is important to use reliable components. The more reliable a component is, the lower the probability of a dangerous failure. Reliability is a measure of random failures within the life limit; it is normally provided in the following formats: • B figures for electromechanical or pneumatic compo- 10 nents. Here, life limit is determined by switching frequency. B indicates the number of switching cycles until 10% of 10
components fail. • Failure rate λ (lambda value) for electronic components. Often the failure rate is stated in FIT (Failures In Time). One FIT is one failure per 109 hours.

These include plausibility monitoring, current and voltage monitoring, watchdog functionality, brief function test, etc. Since all faults cannot always be detected, the degree of fault detection must be defined. A Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) should be performed for this purpose. For complex de- signs, measures and empirical values from standards provide assistance. Resistance to common cause failures The term “common cause failure” (CCF) is used, for example, to refer to both channels failing simultaneously due to interfer- ence.

Safety switches, position switches, and interlocking devices The commonly used term "safety switch" does not appear in the standards because the multitude of technologies and suitable sen- sor designs for interlocking devices does not allow general requirements to be defined. Regardless of the technology used (mechanical, electrical, pneumatic, hydraulic), the following definitions apply: • An interlocking device consists of an actuator and a position switch. • A position switch consists of an actuating element and an output signal element. Depending on the technology of the position switch used and the functional safety requirements, either one or more interlocking devices will be required for a guard. 7028282/2014-09-08 GUIDE FOR SAFE MACHINERY | SICK 3-21 Subject to change without notice Safeguarding (technical protective measures) Risk reduction Mechanical attachment Reliable mechanical attachment of the position switches and • They must be arranged, installed, and mounted so that they actuators is crucial for their effectiveness.

Since an electro-sensitive protective equipment does not rep- resent a physical barrier, it is not able to protect people against emissions such as ejected machine parts, workpieces or chips; Examples of optoelectronic protective devices ionizing radiation; heat (thermal radiation); noise; sprayed coolant and lubricant; etc. Similarly, ESPE cannot be used on An optoelectronic protective device can be used if the op- machines on which long stopping/run-down times require mini- erator is not exposed to any danger of injury due to ejected mum distances that cannot be achieved. parts (e.g., splashes of molten material).

A series of parallel light beams (normally used to safeguard hazardous points directly (see figure). infrared) transmitted from the sender to the receiver form a protective field that safeguards the hazard zone. Detection occurs when an opaque object fully interrupts one or more beams. The receiver signals the beam interruption by
a signal change (OFF state) to its output signal switching devices (OS- 1 SDs). This signals from the OSSDs are used to stop the danger- ous machine functions. The standards IEC 61496-2, UL 61496-2, ANSI B11.19, RIA TR R15.406, and CSA Z432 define safety requirements for AOPDs. Typical AOPDs include single-beam and multiple light beam safety devices and safety light curtains. AOPDs with a capabil- 2 ity to detect a body or arm and not a finger or hand are called multiple light beam safety devices. They are used to protect access to hazard zones (see figure). International standards define this as devices with a detection capability more than 40 mm, whereas North American standards define this limit as 3 more than 64 mm. Hazardous point protection using a safety light curtain c With both multiple light beam safety devices and safety light curtains, rather than all light beams being activated at the same time, they are usually activated and deactivated in rapid sequence one after the other. This increases resistance to interference from other sources of light and increases their reliability accordingly. On state-of-the-art AOPDs, there is auto- matic synchronization between sender and receiver through an optical link. By using microprocessors, the beams can be evaluated indi- vidually. This enables additional ESPE functions to be imple- mented in addition to the protective function itself (g 3-37).

These signals from the Various principles can be used to detect people, including: OSSDs are used to stop the hazardous machine functions. • Interruption of the light reflected by a retro-reflector A safety laser scanner is an optical sensor which monitors • Travel time measurement of the light reflected by an object a hazard zone on a machine or vehicle by scanning the area • Monitoring of changes from background patterns around it on a single plane with infrared light beams. • Detection of persons based on human characteristics It works on the basis of the principle of time-of-flight measure- ment (see the figure below). The scanner sends very short light pulses (S) while an "electronic stopwatch" runs simultaneously. If the light strikes an object, it is reflected and received by the scanner (R). The scanner calculates the distance from the ob- ject from the difference between the send and receive times. A uniformly rotating mirror (M) in the scanner deflects the light pulses such that a sector of a circle is covered. The scanner then determines the exact position of the object from the mea- 3 sured distance and the angle of rotation of the mirror. c Camera-based protective device The future international standard series IEC 61496-4 will state safety requirements for VBPDs. Basic structure of a laser scanner The user can program the area in which object detection trips the protective field. State-of-the-art devices allow multiple areas to be monitored simultaneously as well as switching between these
areas during operation. This feature can be used, for example, to adapt the monitored area to the speed of a vehicle. Safety laser scanners use individually emitted pulses of light in precise directions and do not continuously cover the area to be monitored. Resolutions (detection capabilities) between 30 mm and 150 mm are achieved through this operating principle. With the active scanning principle, safety laser scanners do not need external receivers or reflectors. Safety laser scanners also have to be able to reliably detect objects with extremely low re- flectivity (e.g., black work clothing). The standards IEC 61496-3, ANSI B11.19, RIA TR R15.406, and CSA Z432 state the safety requirements for AOPDDRs. 7028282/2014-09-08 GUIDE FOR SAFE MACHINERY | SICK 3-29 Subject to change without notice Safeguarding (technical protective measures) Risk reduction Detection capability (resolution) of optoelectronic protective devices The detection capability is defined as the limit for the sensor For safety laser scanners (AOPDDR), the detection capability is parameter that causes the electro-sensitive protective equip- dependent upon the distance to the object, the angle between § ment (ESPE) to trigger. the individual beams of light (pulse), and the shape and size of In practice, this is the size of the smallest object detected by the transmitted beam. the ESPE within the defined monitored area (protective field).

The aperture angle of the lens is reduced as far as possible so that disturbance-free operation can even be ensured in the event of minor alignment errors. The same applies to the aperture angle of the receiver (effective aperture angle according to IEC 61496-2). But even for smaller aperture angles, there is the possibility for light beams from the sender to be deflected from reflective surfaces, thus leading to a failure to detect an object (see figures).

the hazardous movement is not stopped. Installation situations of this kind must be avoided. If this is not possible, suitable measures must be taken to prevent mutual interference (assembly of opaque partitions or reversing the direction of transmission of a system, for example). Type 4 AOPDs either must have suitable external sender detec- tion and change to a safe state (outputs in OFF state) when af- fected or have technical means to prevent interference. Beam 3 coding is normally used so that the receiver only responds to light beams from the assigned sender (coded the same, see c The person is detected reliably and the dangerous movement is stopped. figures). Reflection impedes detection by the ESPE and the hazardous movement is not stopped. No mutual interference of protective devices due to the use of light beam coding – person is reliably detected and the hazardous movement is stopped. Accordingly, a minimum distance a must be maintained between all reflective surfaces and objects (e.g., containers, reflective floors) and the protective field of the system (see table "Main differences of type 2 and type 4 AOPDs according to IEC 61496"g 3-30). This minimum distance a depends on the distance D between sender and receiver (protective field width). The minimum dis- tance must be maintained on all sides of the protective field. Preventing mutual interference from AOPDs If several AOPDs are operated in close proximity to each other, the sender beams from a system (S1) can affect the receiver of another system (R2). There is a danger that the affected AOPD will lose its ability to provide protection (see figure).
