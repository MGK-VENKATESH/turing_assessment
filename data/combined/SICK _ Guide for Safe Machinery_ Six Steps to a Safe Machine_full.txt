Switzerland: Federal law on product safety (PrSG) dated June 12, 2009 and Ordinance on the safety of machinery (Machinery Ordinance) dated April 2, 2008 • Austria: Federal act on protection against dangerous products (Product Safety Act 2004 [PSG 2004]) and Machine safety ordinance 2010 If machinery and safety components comply with the Machinery Directive, member states may not prohibit, restrict or impede their being placed on the market and put into service. It is also forbidden for them to apply national laws, ordinances, or standards to impose more stringent requirements! The Work Equipment Directive The obligations for employers are set out in the Work Equipment Directive, which applies to the use of machinery and equipment in the workplace. The directive contains minimum requirements that must be met when using work equipment in order to improve occupational health and safety. Each member state may add its own national requirements: e.g., regarding equipment testing, service and maintenance intervals, the use of personal protective equipment, or the layout of the workplace. The requirements of the Work Equipment Directive as well as national requirements and operating regulations are in turn implemented in national laws. 12 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice § – LAWS, DIRECTIVES, STANDARDS Figure 6: Validation NOTE • Germany: Occupational Safety and Health Act (Arbeitsschutzgesetz (ArbSchGes)), Ordinance on Industrial Safety and Health (Betriebssicherheitsverordnung (BetrSichV)) • Switzerland: Federal legislation on work in industry, commerce and trade (Bundesgesetz über die Arbeit in Industrie, Gewerbe und Handel (SR 822.11, ArG)) • Austria: Labor Protection Act (ArbeitnehmerInnenschutzgesetz (ASchG)) Work Equipment Directive 2009/104 / EC: eur-lex.europa.eu Obligations of the machine manufacturer Safe design of machinery Manufacturers are obliged to design and build their machines such they are compliant with the essential safety and health requirements of the
access to the hazardous area by reaching over a protective field cannot be prevented, the height of the protective field and minimum distance of the ESPE must be determined. This is done by comparing the calculated values based on the possible detection of limbs or body parts with the values resulting from possibly reaching over the protective field. The higher value of this comparison shall be applied. This comparison is to be carried out according to ISO 13855, Section 6.5. If it is not possible to reach over the protective field of the ESPE, C is determined by the detection capability (resolution) of the ESPE and is referred to as C (reach through). If it is possible to reach over the protective field RT of the ESPE, C is determined by the height of the protective field and is referred to as C (reach over).

In particular for metal-working presses, the following applies: Table 37: Supplements for the minimum distances of ESPE on presses according to ISO 16092-1 and ISO 16092-3 Calculation of the supplement for presses Resolution d (mm) of the ESPE Supplement C (mm) Stroke initiation by ESPE/PSDI mode d ≤ 14 0 Allowed 14 < d ≤ 20 80 20 < d ≤ 30 130 30 < d ≤ 40 240 Not allowed > 40 850 NOTE - Press standards: ISO 16092-1, ISO 16092-3 (type-C standards) 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 97 Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION Special case 2: ESPE for presence detection This type of protection is recommended for large sys‐ tems that are accessible from the floor. In this special case, starting of the machine (“preventing start” safety function) must be prevented while there is an opera‐ tor inside. This is a secondary protective device which detects the presence of persons in the hazardous area and simultaneously prevents the machine switching to the dangerous state. In addition to the ESPE for presence detection, there shall be a primary protective measure for the “initiating a stop” safety function, e.g., in the form of another ESPE or a locked, movable physi‐ cal guard. The minimum distance shall be calculated
in this case for the main protective device (e.g., a vertical light cur‐ tain that has the task of stopping the machine). Figure 79: Safety laser scanner on a machining center as safety function pos. 1, initiating a stop and safety function pos. 2, preventing start (presence detection) Special case 3: ESPE applications on autonomous vehicles If the dangerous state is as a result of a collision with an autonomous vehicle, the determination of the mini‐ mum distance is generally based only on the speed the vehicle is traveling and not on the approach speed of the person. It is assumed that the person recognizes the approaching vehicle (vehicle with protective device) and stops or moves away. Figure 80: Hazardous area protection on an autonomous vehicle with safety laser scanners The minimum distance needs to be set to a length that is sufficient to stop the vehicle safely. The minimum distance corresponds to the braking distance of the vehicle. An exact calculation of the braking distance is not possible, as it depends on several factors, e.g., friction between the tire and ground, total weight incl. load, braking force, etc. It is therefore recommended to first calculate the minimum distance and validate (confirm) the result by testing. 98 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION For the calculation, the braking deceleration of the vehicle (a) at nominal load, maximum operating speed (v ) 0 and under the intended operating conditions must be known or determined. The braking distance (S ) is then B calculated as follows: 2 v0 S = B 2a Safety supplements may be necessary depending on the application and the technology used. The calculated value must be validated by two tests: 1. For detecting
a lying person A test body with a diameter of 200 mm and a length of 600 mm must be used. The test body is placed horizontally in a fixed position on the left, in the middle, and on the right of the vehicle path to be protected and orthogonal (perpendicular) to the vehicle path. Figure 81: Positioning of a test body on an autonomous vehi‐ cle for testing the detection of a person lying down 2. For detecting a standing person A test body with a diameter of 70 mm and a length of 400 mm must be used. The test body is placed vertically and completely in a fixed position anywhere on the vehicle path to be protected. Figure 82: Positioning of a test body on an autonomous vehi‐ cle for testing the detection of a standing person 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 99 Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION 3. Validation The vehicle must be loaded with the nominal load and approach the test body at the maximum operating speed. The vehicle must stop in time, therefore either not touch the test body or, if contact occurs, the force applied to the (1) horizontal test body must not exceed 750 N and to the (2) vertical test body must not exceed 250 N. This is the current standardized method to be used for the protection of autonomous vehicles in the industrial sector (ISO 3691-4). The method can also be used for the non-industrial sector, but it is important to consider the following: • It cannot always be assumed that persons will never approach the moving vehicle. Both speeds (person and vehicle) may therefore need to be considered accordingly. • The maximum permissible forces in the event of
contact with children or elderly people are much lower than those specified. • The bodily dimensions of children cannot be simulated using the specified test bodies. In this case, the dimensions of the test bodies should be taken from the relevant literature. Special case 4: Stationary application of an onboard ESPE The way in which some machines function requires that operators are located very close to the hazardous area. On press brakes, small pieces of plate must be held very close to the bending edge. Moving systems that form a protective field around the tool openings have proven to be practical protective devices. Because the hand approach speed of the operator is not taken into account in such applications, the general formula is not applicable. The requirements to be met by the resolution are very high and reflections on metal surfaces shall be prevented. For this reason, focused laser systems with image-based evaluation are used. This type of protection is defined in the type-C standards in conjunction with other measures (e.g., 3-pedal foot switch, automatic stop time measure‐ ment, requirement to wear gloves, etc.). NOTE - Safety of press brakes: EN 12622 (type-C standard) NOTE Specific know-how and equipment are required to measure the stopping/run-down time and the required minimum distance. SICK offers these measurements as a service. Approaches to calculating the minimum distance Solution approach 1: Perpendicular approach – hazardous point protection with presence detection The calculation results in a minimum distance of S = 320 mm (see figure 83). By using a safety light curtain with the best possible resolution (14 mm), this is already the optimal minimum distance. Two AOPDs are used to ensure that the person is detected everywhere in the hazardous area: • a vertical AOPD positioned according to the calculated minimum distance (vertical approach)
- for the safety function: initiating a stop • a horizontal AOPD to eliminate the risk of standing behind - for the safety function: preventing an unexpected start-up 100 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice mm 41 noituloseR S=320 mm H=500 mm b a 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION x = d (resolution of the horizontal AOPD for presence detection) H x= d≤ +50 (or cf. type-C standard) for presence detection 15 x Hazardous area Total stopping/run-down time of the system = 0.16 s S=2,000 × 0.16 + 8 × (14 -14) S=320 mm a = Height of the hazardous area x = End of the protective field to the machine d = Detection capability (resolution of the AOPD) b = Height of the uppermost beam, for determination see “Required H = Installation height protective field size/height of the ESPE” S = Minimum distance Figure 83: Determining the positioning and sizing of ESPE for hazardous point protection and presence detection using a safety light curtain Solution approach 2: Parallel approach – hazardous area protection A horizontal AOPD is used. The following figure shows a horizontally arranged AOPD and the calculation of the minimum distance S. If the installation height of the AOPD is increased to 300 mm, the minimum distance is reduced. For this height, an AOPD with a resolution less than or equal to 80 mm can be used. It must not be possible, however, to access the hazardous area beneath the AOPD (evaluate the risk of crawling beneath). This type of safeguarding is also often implemented using AOPDDR (laser scanners). However, supplements have to be added for these devices for technology-related reasons.

This solution allows the operator to stand between the hazardous area and the AOPD without being detected. For this reason, additional safety measures shall be applied to reduce this risk. The control device (e.g., a reset button) must be positioned so that the entire hazardous area can be overseen. It must not be accessible from the hazardous area. 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 101 Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION S=1,106 mm Hazardous area 1,100 mm 700 mm Total stopping/run-down time of the system = 0.16 s S=1,600 × 0.16 + 850 S=1,106 mm 300 mm Figure 85: Determining the positioning and sizing of ESPE for access protection using a safety multibeam sensor and for a parallel approach Comparison of the results Table 38: Comparison of solution approaches, selection according to operational requirements Solution approach Advantages Disadvantages for stopping/run-down time = 0.16 s 1 Hazardous point protection • Increased productivity, as the oper‐ • Higher price for the protective S = 320 mm

Not to be rec‐ ommended if more than one person is working in the same location. Required protective field size/height of the ESPE As a general rule, the following faults must be excluded when assembling protective devices: • It shall only be possible to reach the hazardous point through the protective field. • In particular, it shall not be possible to reach hazardous points by reaching over/under/around. • If it is possible to stand behind protective devices, additional measures to prevent an unexpected startup are required (e.g., restart interlock, secondary protective device). Once the minimum distance between protective field and the nearest hazardous point has been calculated, the protective field height required must be determined in a further step. This ensures the hazardous point cannot be reached by reaching over. 102 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION Table 39: Examples of correct assembly of ESPE Table 40: Examples of

In practice, this means that the designer shall perform a risk assessment already at the design phase of the machine. The resulting measures shall be incorporated directly into development. Steps 1 to 5 of this guide describe in detail how to proceed here. Preparing technical documents The machine manufacturer shall prepare a technical files according to Annex VII of the Machinery Directive. The technical files are subject to the following criteria: 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 13 Subject to change without notice § – LAWS, DIRECTIVES, STANDARDS • It shall contain all diagrams, calculations, test reports and documents that are relevant to the conformity with the essential health and safety requirements of the Machinery Directive. • It shall be archived for at least ten years from the last day of manufacture of the machine (or the machine type). • Shall be submitted to the authorities on duly reasoned request. NOTE It is not possible to derive from the Machinery Directive an obligation on the manufacturer to supply the complete technical documentation to the purchaser (user) of the machine. Issuing the declaration of conformity After the machine manufacturer has built his machine according to the requirements of the Machinery Directive, he shall declare, in a legally binding manner, conformity with these requirements by issuing a declaration of conformity and marking the machine (CE marking). It is then permitted to place the machine on the market in the European Union. The Machinery Directive explains the process for the conformity assessment.

Alternatively, locks with interlocking mechanisms may be used to prevent access until the hazard is no longer present. Description of the parameters: S Hazardous area • S: Minimum distance in millimeters, measured from the nearest hazardous point to the nearest door opening point. • K: Parameter in millimeters per second, derived from the data for the approach speeds of the body or parts of the body, usually 1,600 mm/s. • T: Stopping/run-down time for the entire system in seconds. • C: Safety distance (s, see table 44). This is nec‐ r essary if it is possible to insert fingers or hands through the opening and towards the hazard zone before a stop signal is generated.

To prevent crawling beneath physical guards, it is normally sufficient if the guards start at 180 mm above the reference level. 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 107 Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION Required height of physical guards in case of low potential hazard according to ISO 13857 C Hazardous area b a Figure 89: Parameters for determining the height requirements for guards Table 45: Required height of physical guards in case of low potential hazard according to ISO 13857 Height a of the hazard‐ Horizontal distance C to the hazardous area (mm) ous area (mm) 2,500 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2,400 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 0 2,200 600 600 500 500 400 350 250 0 0 2,000 1,100 900 700 600 500 350 0 0 0 1,800 1,100 1,000 900 900 600 0 0 0 0 1,600 1,300 1,000 900 900 500 0 0 0 0 1,400 1,300 1,000 900 800 100 0 0 0 0 1,200 1,400 1,000 900 500 0 0 0 0 0 1,000 1,400 1,000 900 300 0 0 0 0 0 800 1,300 900 600 0 0 0 0 0 0 600 1,200 500 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 400 1,200 300 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 200 1,100 200 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1,100 200 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Height b of the physical guard (mm) 1,000

If the
height of the physical guard is to be 1,600 mm, the safety distance must be increased to at least 800 mm. Proceed as follows to determine the required height of the top edge of the physical guard for this safety distance: 1. Determine the height of the hazardous point a and find the value in the left-hand column, e.g., 1,000 mm. 2. In this row, find the first column in which the horizontal distance C is less than the safety distance calculated, e.g., the first field with the value “0”. 3. Read the resulting height b for the physical guard in the bottom row, e.g., 1,800 mm.

(type-B standard) Application of reset and restart If a protective device triggers a stop command, the stop status must be maintained until a safe state for a restart exists. The risk assessment may indicate that the stop status must only be ended by means of a manual, separate and intentional reset. The machine can be restarted in a further step. The reset must be performed using a special operated device. The operated device must be able to withstand the foreseeable stresses and must be used properly to prevent unintentional actuation (touch panels may be unsuita‐ ble). Furthermore, the device must be installed in a safe location outside the hazardous area. The hazardous area must be fully visible from this location to ensure that no person is in the hazardous area. The signal from the operated device must enable the controller to issue a separate start command for restarting. The signal processing must ensure that the restart can only take place if all safety functions and protective devices are functional. 110 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION ISO 13849-1 (section 5.2.2) therefore requires that resetting may only occur by releasing the command device from its actuated (ON) position and that the signal processing should detect the falling signal edge of the command device. This means that the acknowl‐ edgment must only occur by releasing the actuating element from its actuated (ON) position. Figure 92: The position of the reset pushbutton allows a full view of the hazardous area when resetting the protective device. Manual resetting is a safety function and must be implemented accordingly, e.g., by applying the ISO 13849-1 or IEC 62061 standards. The signal (on actuation) of the reset device is part of the
Machinery Directive are subject to the standard process. The “Essential health and safety requirements” described in Annex I must be met. The manufacturer shall then compile the technical files and apply the CE marking. This process does not require the involvement of a third party (test body or authority). The technical files shall be provided to the national market authorities upon duly reasoned request. Figure 7: Safeguarding of a machine and diagnostics on the protective device • Procedure for machinery that is listed in Annex IV: Machines that are particularly hazardous are subject to special procedures. Annex IV of the Machinery Directive contains a list of particularly hazardous machinery and also safety components; this list includes electro-sensitive protective equipment such as photoelectric safety switches and safety laser scanners. The “Essential health and safety requirements” in Annex I of the Machinery Directive must be met first. If applicable harmonized standards covering all relevant health and safety requirements are available for the machinery or safety components, the declaration of conformity can then be obtained in one of the following three ways: Self-certification by the standard procedure ° EC type examination by a notified body: A notified body tests whether the machine meets the relevant ° essential health and safety requirements applicable to the machinery or the safety component. On com‐ pliance with those requirements, the notified body issues an EC type examination certificate containing the results of the tests. Use of a full quality management system that has been assessed (QMS): The full QMS shall ensure ° conformity with the requirements of the Machinery Directive and be assessed by a notified body. The manufacturer is responsible for the effective and appropriate use of the QMS. See also Annex X of the Machinery Directive. If no applicable harmonized standards exist for the machinery
safety function. One of the following measures must therefore be implemented: • The signal must be discretely wired to the safety-related logic unit. • The signal must be transmitted via a safety-related bus system. The reset shall not initiate any movement or hazardous situation. Instead, the machine control system shall only accept a separate start command after the reset. 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 111 Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION An exception to the application of reset and restart exists if protective devices are used that allow continu‐ ous detection of at-risk persons in the hazardous area (e.g., presence detection). Figure 93: In this arrangement, it is not possible to remain in the hazardous area without being detected by the protective device. Therefore, a separate reset of the protective device is not necessary. Integration of protective devices in the control system Along with mechanical aspects, a protective device must also be integrated in the control system. NOTE "Control systems are functional assemblies that form part of the information system of a machine and implement logical functions. They coordinate the flows of material and energy to the area of action of the tool and workpiece system in the context of a task. […] control systems differ in terms of the technology used, i.e., the information carriers, fluid, electrical and electronic control systems."

The control system comprises input elements, logic units, power control elements, and drive/actuator elements. Safety-related parts of the control system are designed to perform safety functions. For this reason special requirements are placed on their reliability and
their resistance to errors. They are based on the principles of preventing and controlling faults. 112 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION Table 47: Safety aspects of control systems with different operating principles.

In other words, the electrical signals are converted to fluid energy by valves to move cylinders and other power control elements. 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 113 Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION Logic units In a logic unit, different input signals are linked to output signals. Electromechanical, electronic, or programmable electronic components are often used for this purpose.

Function: If the contactors K1 and K2 are de-energized, on pressing S1 the K3 contactor is energized and remains energized. If no object is detected in the active protective field, the outputs OSSD1 and OSSD2 are conducting voltage. The contactors K1 and K2 are energized by the normally open contacts on K3 and latch. K3 is de-energized by releasing S1. Only then are the output circuits closed.

They generally also have automatic monitoring functions. The cut-off paths can be set up based on contact or using semiconductors. They can also have signaling contacts. Building more complex safety applications is simplified by integrating multiple functions into one device. The certified safety relay also reduces the time and effort involved in validating the safety functions. In safety relays, semiconductor elements can perform the task of the electromechanical switching elements instead of relays. Using measures to detect faults such as the sampling of dynamic signals or
measures to control faults such as multiple channel signal processing, purely electronic control systems can achieve the necessary degree of reliability. Logic unit with software-based components Similar to automation technology, safety technology has developed from hard-wired auxiliary contactors through safety relays (some with configurable safety logic for which parameters can be set) to complex fail-safe PLCs. The concept of “proven components” and “proven safety principles” must be transferred to electrical and programma‐ ble electronic systems. The logical operators for the safety function are implemented in the software. Software is to be differentiated from firmware — developed and certified by the manufacturer of the control device — and the actual safety application, which is developed by the machine manufacturer using the functionality supported by the firmware. The choice and adjustment of the functions of logic units is offered in different levels of flexibility: • Parameterization • Configuration • Programming Parameterization Is the selection of properties from a defined pool of functionality by selector switch/software parameters at the time of commissioning. Features: low logic depth, AND/OR logic Configuration Flexible operators for defined function blocks in certified logic with a software-supported configuration interface, parameterization of times and configuration of the inputs/outputs of the control system, for example. Features: any logic depth, binary logic Figure 96: Example of linking the function blocks of a software-supported logic unit 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 115 Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION Programming Defines the logic as required using the functional‐ ity defined by the predefined programming language, mostly using certified function blocks.

Insertion An examination of the hardware and software errors Sender Receiver that arise in transmission systems shows that these errors lead to the following transmission errors in bus systems: Wrong order • Repetition Sender Receiver • Loss • Insertion Corruption • Wrong sequence • Corruption Sender Receiver • Data delay Transmission errors can be avoided using various Delay measures in the higher-level control system, e.g., by Sender Receiver sequential numbering of the safety-related telegrams Source: Safety in Construction and Design of Printing and Paper Converting Machines – or a time expectation for incoming telegrams with Electrical Equipment and Control Systems, BG Druck- und Papierverarbeitung (today BG ETEM); Edition 06/2004; page 79 acknowledgment.

To detect systematic errors, a thorough system‐ atic check should be made by someone other than the designer and thus the principle of counter-checking by a second person applied. A simple way of implementing this specification is the so-called design matrix. Here certain combinations of safety-related input signals for specific cases (e.g., “position lost”, or “robot left”) are combined. These cases shall act on the machine functions via the safety- related outputs in accordance with the requirements of the safety function. This simple method is also used by SICK during the design of application software. It is advisable to have this reviewed by all involved in the project. In the case of programs that are poorly documented and unstructured, errors occur during subsequent mod‐ ifications; in particular, there is a risk of unknown dependencies or side effects, as they are often referred to. When the software is developed externally, good specifications and program documentation are very effective in avoiding
faults. stupni ytefaS toboR tfel no elbaT thgir no elbaT ... ...

For this purpose, the drive/actuator elements are switched off by power control elements. NOTE - Principle of switch off/power shutdown: ISO 13849-2 (type-B standard) Contactors Electromechanical contactors are the most commonly used type of power control element. One or more contactors can form a safety function subsystem by combining special selection criteria, wiring, and technical measures. By protecting the contacts against overcurrent and short-circuits, over-sizing (normally by a factor of 2) and other measures, a contactor is considered a proven component. To be able to perform diagnostics on contactors for safety functions, unambiguous feedback of the output state is necessary (EDM = external device monitoring). This requirement can be met using a contactor with positively guided contacts. The contacts are positively guided when the contacts in a set of contacts are mechanically linked in such a way that normally open contacts and normally closed contacts can never be closed simultaneously during at any point during the intended mission time. 118 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice The term “positively guided contacts” refers primarily Normally closed to auxiliary contactors and auxiliary contacts. A defined contact ≥0.5 mm distance between the contacts of at least 0.5 mm at the normally closed
contact must be ensured even in Normally open contact the event of a fault (welded N/O contact). Since on contactors with low switching capacity (< 4 kW) there is essentially no difference between the main contact elements and the auxiliary contact elements, it is also possible to use the term “positively guided contacts” to refer to those small contactors. ≥0.5 mm Normally closed contacts On larger contactors, what are known as “mirror con‐ tacts” are used: While a main contact on a contactor is closed, no mirror contact (auxiliary normally closed Normally open contacts contact) is allowed to be closed. A typical application for mirror contacts is the highly reliable monitoring of the output state of a contactor in control circuits on machines. GA relleoM :ecruoS 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION Figure 102: Contact system of a contactor with positively guided contacts. A normally-open contact is welded. Suppressor elements Inductances such as coils on valves or contactors must be equipped with a suppressor to limit transient voltage spikes on shutdown. In this way the switching element is protected against overload (in particular against overvolt‐ age on particularly sensitive semiconductors). As a rule, such circuits have an effect on the release delay and, therefore, on the required minimum distance of the protective device (see "Approaches to calculating the minimum distance", page 100). A simple diode for arc suppression can result in a release (switch to OFF) time up to 14 times longer.

Drive technology When considering safety functions, drives represent a central sub-function, as they pose a risk of unintentional movement, for example. The safety function extends from the sensor to the power-controlling element.

Braking systems and holding systems are also to be taken into account on axes subject to gravity. The actual motor is not part of the assessment. Servo amplifiers and frequency inverters In drive technology, three-phase motors with frequency inverters have largely replaced DC drives. The inverter generates an output voltage of variable frequency and amplitude from the fixed three-phase mains. Depending on design, regulated rectifiers can feed the energy absorbed by the intermediate circuit during braking back to the mains. The rectifier converts the electrical power supplied from the mains and feeds it to the DC intermediate circuit. To perform the required control function, the inverter forms a suitable revolving field for the motor using pulse-width modulation and semiconductor switches. The usual switching frequencies are between 4 kHz and 12 kHz.

NOTE The CE marking can only be affixed if the machine meets all applicable European directives. Only a machine with the CE marking is allowed to be placed on the market in the European Union. Special case: Partly completed machinery In many cases, parts of machines, machine assemblies, or machine components are manufactured and delivered that are very close to the definition of a machine but cannot be considered complete machines in the context of the Machinery Directive. The Machinery Directive defines as “partly completed machinery” an assembly of components that almost form a machine, but that on their own cannot perform any specific function. An individual industrial robot, for example, is a partly completed machine. A partly completed machine is only intended to be installed in other machinery or in other partly completed machinery or equipment, or to be combined with such machinery or equipment in order to form a machine in the context of the Directive. Partly completed machinery cannot meet all requirements of the Machinery Directive. Therefore, the Machinery Directive regulates their free trade using a special procedure: • The manufacturer shall meet all reasonably achievable essential health and safety requirements

During the consideration of the residual travel, it is to be assumed that the motion control system does not initiate a brake ramp. After shutdown, the drive continues running at more or less the same speed, depending on the friction (stop category 0). The use of a brake ramp by changing the setpoint and/or controller
enable and subsequent shutdown of the contactor or the pulse inhibit (stop category 1) can reduce the braking distance. t Emergency stop Speed Mains contactor Figure 106: Disconnection of the supply of power by the mains contactor after emergency stop and initiation of a braking ramp Speed detection with external monitoring units To monitor the drive, external monitoring units require various signals providing information about the current movement parameters. In this case the signal sources are sensors and encoders. These must either be designed as safe sensors or with redundancy, depending on the required safety level PL or SIL. Alternatively, standstill monitoring can also be implemented by reading back the voltage induced by the motor coasting down. This technique also functions with speed-controlled drives. Safety sub-functions integrated in the drive Safety functions are implemented by safety-related parts of control systems (SRP/CS). They include the sub-func‐ tions of measuring (sensor), processing (logic unit), and switching or actuation (power control element). In this context, safety-related functions integrated in the drive are to be considered safety sub-functions. They are generally divided into two groups: • Safety-related stopping and braking functions: These functions are used to stop the drive safely (e.g., safe stop). • Safe monitoring functions: These functions are used for the safe monitoring of the drive during operation (e.g., safely reduced speed). In general, the drive monitoring functions necessary depend on the application. Boundary conditions include parameters such as the necessary braking distance, the presence of kinetic energy, etc. The shutdown response varies depending on the selected safety sub-function. For example, on a stop request, safe torque off (STO) results in uncontrolled coasting down of the movement. During a safe stop (SS1 or SS2), controlled retardation is initiated. A combination of element functions may also need to be implemented as a suitable
measure. Possible interfaces for the implementation of safety sub-functions integrated directly in the drive are: • Discrete 24-V signals • Control communication (channel 1)/24 V discrete (channel 2) • Safe communication systems (field-bus systems/network interface) In control communication, a setpoint for speed or position is transmitted from the standard controller to the drive; via a non-safety fieldbus or a network. The majority of safety sub-functions for variable speed drives available today are specified in the harmonized standard IEC 61800-5-2 “Adjustable speed electrical power drive systems”, Part 5-2 “Safety requirements – Functional safety”. Drives that meet this standard can be used as safety-related parts of a control system in accordance with ISO 13849-1 or IEC 62061. 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 121 Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION Safety functions of servo drives according to IEC 61800-5-2 Table 49: Safety functions of servo drives according to IEC 61800-5-2.

The most frequent causes of the safety-related failure of valves are: 122 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION
• Failure of functional elements of the valve (reset function, switching function, sealing function) • Contamination of the fluid Contamination constitutes unintended use and generally leads to malfunctions. A general rule for all valves is that contamination leads to premature wear, thus negating the essential prerequisites used for design and dimensioning based on a defined probability of failure. The mechanical springs for the reset function used in monostable valves are generally designed for high endur‐ ance and can be considered proven in accordance with ISO 13849-2. However, exclusion of failure in the event of the springs breaking is not possible. An important differentiating factor between the valves is the design of the moving switching element inside the valve. The failure mode for each valve is essentially determined by its design. Poppet valves might leak, but in piston valves, the piston slide might jam. With a poppet valve, the switching function is effected by the moving switching element (valve plate), which changes position relative to a seat inside the housing. This design enables large cross-sections to be released with short strokes. The risk of leaks can be excluded with an appropriate design. In the case of piston valves, the valve body closes or opens the flow path by moving over a bore or circumferential groove. The changes in the cross-section of the piston slide relative to the changes in cross-section inside the housing affect volume flow and are known as control edges. An essential feature of this valve design worthy of note is what is known as the lap. The lap is the longitudinal distance between the stationary and moving control edges of the slide valve. Due to the gap between the piston and the housing bore required for hard-sealing valves, a leak will occur in the event of a pressure
differential. Safety-related design principles For the safety-related use of valves, feedback of the valve position may be necessary. Here various techniques are used: • Reed switches that are actuated by a magnet fixed into the moving valve body • Inductive proximity switches that are actuated directly by the moving switching element of the valve • Analog position detection of the moving switching element of the valve • Pressure measurement downstream of the valve In the case of electromagnetically actuated valves, like a contactor, the solenoid requires a suppressor. In terms of safety as defined in ISO 13849, valves are defined as power control elements. The failure of drives/work elements must also be considered according to the possible repercussions. Figure 107: Valve with position monitoring Filter concept The vast majority of failures of fluid control systems are due to disturbances related to contamination of the related fluid. The two main causes are: 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 123 Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION • Contamination that occurs during assembly = assembly contamination (e.g., chips, mold sand, fibers from cloths, basic contamination) • Contamination that occurs during operation = operating contamination (e.g., ambient contamination, compo‐ nent abrasion) These contaminations must be reduced to an acceptable degree with the aid of filters. For this purpose, a filter concept must be developed that defines the filter principle and its installation location. The filter concept must be designed so that it is able to retain in the filter the contamination added to the entire system in such a way that the required purity is maintained throughout the operating time.

BIA Report 6/2004 ISBN 3-88383-672-9 Safety-related pneumatics Electropneumatic control systems use a logic unit to implement safety functions. The logic unit provides electrical signals that act on the drive/actuators via a combination of a number of valves; these valves act as power control elements. Typical safety-related functions can be allocated to a machine’s operating modes as safety sub-functions. Purely pneumatic control systems exist alongside electropneumatic control systems. The advantage of these solutions is that the deterministic nature of the pneumatics makes it relatively easy to set up safety sub-functions that are purely pneumatic. 124 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION Aerate Hold pressure Pressure and Vent force reduction Initial setting, standstill Setup and Normal operation service mode Two-hand Protection against operation tampering, protection against Emergency operation unexpected starting Reduction in Switch to Stop, hold, block Reverse the speed zero force the movement movement Direct pneumatic effect on movement Indirect pneumatic effect on movement Source: Festo SE & Co.

Summary: Designing the safety function General • Develop a concept for the required safety functions. In this concept, consider the characteristics of the machine, design, surroundings, protective device, and also take into account human characteristics. • Design appropriate safety functions for the required safety level. Safety functions comprise sensor, logic, and power control element subsystems. • Determine the safety level of each subsystem based on safety aspects (structure, reliability, diagnostics, resistance, process conditions). Properties and application of protective devices • Determine the necessary properties for your protective device. Do you need, for example, one or more elec‐ tro-sensitive protective devices (ESPE), physical guards, movable physical guards or position fixing protective devices? • Determine the correct positioning and dimensions for each protective device, in particular the safety distance (minimum distance) and the necessary protective field size/height for the protective device concerned. • Integrate the protective devices as stated in the instruction handbook and as necessary for the level of safety. Logic units • Choose a suitable logic unit based on the number of safety functions and the logic depth. • Use certified function blocks and keep your design clear. • Have the design and the documentation thoroughly checked (principle of counter checking by a second person). 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 127 Subject to change

Verification essentially involves the following: • Verification of physical guards • Verification of functional safety • Verification of the design of non-physical guards Verification of physical guards In the case of physical guards, the design must be checked to ascertain whether the devices meet requirements with regard to separation or distancing from hazardous points and/or requirements with regard to the restraining of ejected parts, hazardous substances or radiation. Particular attention should be paid to compliance with ergonomic requirements. This is to ensure that the protective device provides the protection that meets the requirements. Separating and/or distancing effect • Sufficient safety distance and dimensioning (reaching over, reaching under, etc.) • Suitable mesh size or grid spacing for fence elements • Sufficient rigidity and suitable mounting • Selection of suitable materials • Safe setup • Resistance to aging • Design of the guard prevents climbing on the guard Restraining of ejected parts, hazardous substances or radiation • Sufficient rigidity, impact resistance, fracture strength (retention) • Sufficient retention for the prevailing type of radiation, in particular where thermal hazards are concerned (heat, cold) • Suitable mesh size or grid spacing for fence elements • Sufficient rigidity and suitable mounting • Selection of suitable materials • Safe setup • Resistance to aging Ergonomic requirements • Suitable transparency (so that machine operation can be observed) • Setup, color, aesthetics • Handling (weight, actuation, etc.) Verification of non-physical guards Depending on the type of non-physical guard (safety light curtains, pressure sensitive mats, ...), different system‐ atic properties must be verified. The effectiveness of a non-physical guard can
be tested with the help of a checklist. 128 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 3D – VERIFYING THE SAFETY FUNCTION Table 51: Example checklist for the manufacturer or equipment supplier when installing non-physical guards (e.g., an ESPE) Checklist 1 Have adequate measures been taken to prevent access to hazardous areas or hazardous points or can they only be accessed via safeguarded areas (ESPE, protective doors with Yes ⃞ No ⃞ interlocking device)? 2 Have appropriate measures been taken to prevent the undetected presence of persons in the hazardous area (mechanical protection) or to detect the presence of persons (protective Yes ⃞ No ⃞ devices), and have these devices been secured or locked to prevent their removal? 3 Do the protective devices conform to the required reliability level (PL or SIL) for the relevant Yes ⃞ No ⃞ safety functions? 4 Has the maximum overrun (stopping time) of the respective dangerous machine functions been measured and are these times specified and documented (either on the machine or in Yes ⃞ No ⃞ the operating instructions)? 5 Have the required safety or minimum distances of protective devices to the nearest hazard‐ Yes ⃞ No ⃞ ous points been maintained? 6 Have effective measures been taken to prevent reaching under, reaching over, climbing Yes ⃞ No ⃞ under, climbing over, or reaching around the protective devices? 7 Have the protective devices or switches been properly mounted and secured against manip‐ Yes ⃞ No ⃞ ulation after adjustment? 8 Are the required protective measures against electric shock in effect (protection class)?

Such a chain can include discrete elements such as guard interlocking devices or valves, but also complex safety controllers. Safety functions are therefore often divided into subsystems to reduce complexity. In practice, pre-certified subsystems are often used for safety functions. PL or PFH values are provided by the D manufacturer for these subsystems, e.g., for a safety light curtain or a safety controller.

according to ISO 13849-1", page 132): Calculation of the perform‐ ance level based on the PFH values of the subsystems. (This method is only described indirectly in the D standard). More realistic performance levels than those using the simplified method can be determined by applying the detailed method. For both methods, structural and systematic aspects relating to the achievement of the perform‐ ance level must also be taken into account in addition to the quantitative assessments.

If the PL of all subsystems is known, the overall PL achieved by a safety function D can be determined using the following table. This method is based on mean values within the PFH value ranges for the different PLs. Therefore, using the D detailed method (see next section) may deliver more accurate results.

the lowest PL (low) is “e”. • The number of subsystems with this PL is 3 (i.e., ≤ 3). Therefore, the overall PL achieved is “e”. • According to this method, adding another subsystem with a PL of “e” would reduce the overall PL to “d”. 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 131 Subject to change without notice Example 2: • One subsystem achieves PL “d”, two subsystems achieve PL “c”. The lowest PL (low) is, therefore, “c”. • The number of subsystems with this PL is 2 (i.e. ≤ 2). Therefore, the overall PL achieved is “c”. This method is based on mean values within the PFH value ranges for the different PLs. Therefore, using the D detailed method (see next section) may deliver more accurate results. NOTE - If the PL is not known for all subsystems, their safety level can be determined (see "Determining the safety level of a subsystem", page 132). Detailed procedure according to ISO 13849-1 An essential – but not exclusive – criterion for determining the PL is the “probability of a dangerous failure per hour (PFH )” of the safety components. The resulting PFH value is the sum of the individual PFH values. D D D Determining the safety level of a subsystem If the PFH value is not known for all subsystems, then their safety level can be determined. Subsystems can D consist of several components, even from different manufacturers. Examples of components in subsystems: • Input side: 2 safety switches on a physical guard • Output side: 1 contactor and 1 frequency inverter to stop a dangerous movement For these subsystems with multiple components, the PL must be determined separately. The performance level achieved for a subsystem is made up of the following parameters: • Structure and
behavior of the safety function under fault conditions ("Structure and category of safety-related parts of controllers", page 132) • MTTF values of individual components ("Mean time to dangerous failure (MTTF )", page 133) D D • Diagnostic coverage ("Diagnostic coverage (DC)", page 134) • Common cause failure ("Common cause failure (CCF)", page 135) • Software aspects that are relevant to safety • Systematic failures erutcurtS ytilibaileR scitsongaiD ecnatsiseR ssecorP 3D – VERIFYING THE SAFETY FUNCTION Performance Level Cat. MTTF DC CCF Check D Figure 112: Aspects for determining the performance level of a subsystem Structure and category of safety-related parts of controllers Subsystems are usually single-channel or dual-channel. Unless additional measures are in place, single-channel systems respond to errors with a dangerous failure. Errors can be detected by introducing additional testing components or dual-channel systems supporting reciprocal testing. ISO 13849-1 defines categories for classifying the structure of subsystems: 132 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 3D – VERIFYING THE SAFETY FUNCTION Table 53: Description of the categories according to ISO 13849-1 Category Brief summary of requirements System behavior Principles for achieving safety B The safety-related parts of con‐ • The occurrence of an error can trol systems and/or their protec‐ result in the loss of the safety tive devices, as well as their com‐ function. ponents, must be set up, built, selected, assembled, and com‐ bined in compliance with applica‐ ble standards so that they are Primarily characterized by compo‐ able to tolerate anticipated influ‐ nent selection encing factors. 1 The requirements of category B • The occurrence of an error can must be met.

Mean time to dangerous failure (MTTF ) D MTTF stands for Mean Time To Failure. From the point of view of ISO 13849-1, only dangerous failures need to be considered (hence the “D” for “dangerous” in MTTF ). D
This value represents a theoretical parameter expressing the probability of a dangerous failure of a component (not the entire subsystem) within the lifetime of that component. The actual lifetime of the subsystem is always shorter. The MTTF value can be derived from the failure rates. Where: 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 133 Subject to change without notice • The B values apply to electromechanical or pneumatic components. Their maximum lifetime depends on 10 the wear and the switching frequency. B therefore indicates the number of switching cycles until 10% of the 10 components fail. • The B value is concerned with the dangerous failure of components (the “D” in B stands for “danger‐ 10D 10D ous”). The value indicates the number of switching cycles until 10% of the components fail dangerously. If the B value is not specified, it may generally be assumed that: B = 2 × B 10D 10D 10 • The failure rate λ applies to electronic components. Often the failure rate is given in FIT (Failures In Time). FIT=1 means one failure per 109 hours. ISO 13849-1 combines the MTTF values into ranges: D Table 54: Ranges of the MTTF value according to ISO 13849-1 D Designation Range Low 3 years ≤ MTTF < 10 years D Medium 10 years ≤ MTTF < 30 years D High 30 years ≤ MTTF < 100 years D The mean time to a dangerous failure in years (MTTF ) can be calculated for the overall system from the D component values. To avoid overrating the impact of reliability, the useful maximum value for the MTTF has been limited to D 100 years. ]%[ eruliaf suoregnad a fo ytilibaborP 100% Unacceptable MTTF D 80% Low MTTF D Medium MTTF D 60% 40% High MTTF D

The diagnostic coverage (DC) is a measure of the capability to detect dangerous errors. Poor diagnostics only detect a few errors, good diagnostics detect a large number of or even all failures. Instead of a detailed analysis (FMEA), the ISO 13849-1 standard contains various quantified measures. The DC is divided into various ranges: 134 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 3D – VERIFYING THE SAFETY FUNCTION Table 55: CCF measures with the maximum achievable values according to ISO 13849-1 Designation Range None DC < 60% Low 60% ≤ DC < 90% Medium 90% ≤ DC < 99% High 99% ≤ DC λ DC = 50% DD λ SFF= 75% S λ D Common cause failure (CCF) External influences (e.g., voltage level, overtemperature) can cause several identical components to become unusable at the same time, regardless of how infrequently they would otherwise fail or how well they have been tested. To illustrate this: When the light goes out, you can neither read the newspaper with one eye or with both eyes because it is dark. Such common cause failures must be prevented. Annex F of ISO 13849-1 provides a simplified method to evaluate measures taken against CCF. A maximum number of points is defined for each measure. Suitable points are awarded for each measure that has been applied.

and test criteria • Documentation and configuration management The process for the correct implementation of safety-relevant topics is part of the remit of managers and includes appropriate quality management.

The requirements for systematic safety integrity Avoidance of failures ° Management of systematic errors ° Here – similar to ISO 13849-1 – to determine the PL the safety function is first broken down into function blocks and then transferred to subsystems.

Example In the figure above, all subsystems achieve SIL3. The addition of the PFH values does not exceed 1 × 10–7. The relevant D measures for systematic safety integrity are in place. Therefore, the safety function achieves SIL3. Systematic safety integrity When different subsystems are interconnected to create a control system, additional measures for systematic safety integrity must be taken to avoid systematic errors. Measures for avoiding systematic hardware errors include, amongst other things, the following: • Design in accordance with the functional safety plan • Correct selection, combination, arrangement, assembly, and installation of subsystems, including cabling, wiring, and other connections • Use within the manufacturer's specifications • Compliance with application instructions provided by the manufacturer (catalog data, installation instructions, and application of proven practical experience, for example) • Observance of requirements with regard to electrical equipment in accordance with IEC 60204-1 Furthermore, consideration must be given to the control of systematic errors, for example through
the following measures: • Cutting off the power supply to induce a safe status • Measures to manage the effects of errors and other effects arising out of a shared data communication process, including transmission errors, repeats, loss, insertion, incorrect sequence, corruption, delay, etc. Determining the level of safety for a subsystem as per IEC 62061 IEC 62061 also supports the determination of the safety level of subsystems created by interconnecting individual components. erutcurtS ytilibaileR scitsongaiD ecnatsiseR ssecorP 3D – VERIFYING THE SAFETY FUNCTION SIL Safety integrity level HFT PFH DC/SFF CCF Check D Figure 116: Aspects for determining the safety integrity level of a subsystem The safety integrity level (SIL) achieved for a subsystem is made up of the following parameters: • Hardware fault tolerance (HFT) • PFH value D • Safe failure fraction (SFF) • Common cause failures (CCF) • Software aspects that are relevant to safety • Systematic failures 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 139 Subject to change without notice 3D – VERIFYING THE SAFETY FUNCTION Hardware fault tolerance (HFT) IEC 62061 defines the structure based on subsystem types and hardware fault tolerance (HFT).

Result - Determining the SIL for the subsystem First, the safety integrity of the hardware is determined separately for each subsystem: If the subsystems are already developed (as is the case with safety light curtains, for example), the manufacturer of the subsystem will supply the corresponding parameters in the context of the technical specification. A subsys‐ tem of this type is usually described in sufficient detail by the specification of SIL, PFH , and mission time. D For subsystems consisting of subsystem elements (interlocking devices for protective doors or contactors, for example), on the other hand, safety integrity must be determined. SIL claim limit Once the hardware tolerance (architecture) has been specified, the maximum achievable SIL (SIL claim limit) can be determined for the subsystem.

Validation shall show that safety-related parts of the control function meet the requirements of ISO 13849-2, in particular the requirements for the level of safety defined. Insofar as is reasonable, validation should be carried out by persons who were not involved in the design of the safety-related parts of the control systems. In the validation process, it is important to check errors and in particular omissions in the formulated specification. The critical part of how a safety-related control function has been designed is usually the specification. For example, access to a robot cell is to be safeguarded by a light curtain. The safety function is thus specified as follows: “If the protective field of a light curtain is interrupted, all hazardous machine functions shall cease as quickly as possible.” However, the designer shall also have considered restarting when the protective field becomes clear again, in particular if access can be gained to it by standing behind this field. The validation process shall uncover such aspects. As a rule, a validation process involves the application of a number of procedures that complement each other.
(International Electrotechnical Commission) The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) is a global organization that pre‐ pares and publishes international standards in the area of electrical technology (e.g., electronics, communications, electromagnetic compatibility, power generation), and related technologies. Types of standards There are three types of standards: Type-A Type-A standards, also called basic safety standards, contain basic terminology, principles of design and general aspects that can be applied to all machinery. Type-B Type-B standards, also called generic safety standards, address a safety aspect or protective device that can be used for a wide range of machinery. Type-B standards are in turn divided into: • Type-B1 standards on specific safety aspects, e.g., the electrical safety of machinery, the calculation of safety distances, requirements for control systems • Type-B2 standards on protective devices, e.g., two-hand control devices, physical guards and electro-sensitive protective equipment Type-C Type-C standards contain all safety requirements for a specific machine or a type of machine. If this standard exists, it has priority over the type-A or type-B standard. A type-C standard may, however, refer to a type-B or type-A standard.

This creates new challenges for information security and must be taken into account to prevent injury to persons or damage to machines and systems or the environment. Consequently, this necessitates an overall assessment of machine safety and information security aspects by component manufacturers, machine manufacturers, system integrators and plant operators. The overall assess‐ ment always starts with defining the limits of the machine (usage limits and spatial limits). The limits also include communication interfaces relevant to cybersecurity, both between humans and machines, between machines and the control system, and between machines. A risk assessment or hazard assessment is performed based on these limits. Based on the risk analysis, all sources of danger are analyzed and appropriate measures taken. Cybersecurity attacks do not create new hazards in terms of machine safety, but the effectiveness of protective measures can be negatively impacted or interrupted. For example, the system components
associated with a safety requirement might not stop or speeds might not be reduced to the necessary level, creating hazards. Cybersecurity considerations are relevant to the following machines: • Machines with programmable controllers with electronic interfaces • Machines with programmable controllers with a network connection Machines with contact-based controls or machines with electronic but non-programmable controllers are not directly relevant to cybersecurity considerations. If electronically parameterizable components are integrated, hazards can in turn arise via the interface to the parameterization device. What measures are necessary to address the cybersecurity aspects of machine safety? Protective measures familiar from office communications or in the private sphere (firewall, virus scanner) are not sufficient for the industrial environment. A systematic approach is necessary. In general, the following applies to all participants operating in the value chain • the corporate culture and thus awareness within the company of the issue of cybersecurity must be suffi‐ ciently developed. • an appropriate safety management system must be installed. • the relevant knowledge must be up to date. • the necessary technologies with an appropriate level of IT security must be available. 148 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 3F – FUNCTIONAL SAFETY AND CYBERSECURITY Figure 121: Review of the safety management in a production plant The following table summarizes the machine security related aspects that machine manufacturers, equipment manufacturers, system integrators, service providers, equipment and machine operators need to consider to prevent cybersecurity attacks: Table 58: Machine security related aspects that machine manufacturers, equipment manufacturers, system integrators, service providers, equipment/machine operators need to consider to prevent cybersecurity attacks Machine manufacturer Equipment manufacturer, system inte‐ Plant/machine operator grator, service provider Security risk assessment Security risk assessment Security threat assessment E.g., according to IEC TR63074.

Information that is relevant to safety must be formu‐ lated in a way that is clear, easy to understand, suc‐ cinct, and precise. Interactive means of communication must be easy to understand and support intuitive oper‐ ation. Figure 123: Examples of information and warnings on machines Safety-relevant information in the operating instructions The
operating instructions must include all safety-relevant information for the machine. The following information, in particular, must be provided: • Safety instructions advising how to safely use the machine, as well as any warnings relevant to a specific action • Description of the intended use, and warnings relating to reasonably foreseeable misuse of the machine • Notes about commissioning and operation of the machine as well as about required training and/or briefing of operating personnel • Information on residual risks, including warnings, that remain despite the measures taken to incorporate safety into the design and application of protective devices and complementary protective measures • Instructions for protective measures to be taken by the user and personal protective equipment requirements • Conditions under which requirements with regard to stability are met in the various phases of the machine’s life cycle • Safety notes on transport, handling, and storage • Instructions on the procedures to be followed in the event of accidents or incidents and for safe troubleshoot‐ ing • Instructions on safe setup and maintenance and the required protective measures associated with these • Specification of the spare parts to be used which may affect the health and safety of operating personnel Documentation NOTE The Safexpert® software from the company ibf ("Risk assessment using Safexpert®", page 27) makes it easy to meet the requirements on the technical documentation. For instance the user can integrate information from the risk assessment directly in the instruction handbook. 152 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 4 – INFORMATION FOR USE Figure 124: Safexpert® operating instructions wizard Summary of steps 2, 3 and 4 for risk reduction General To reduce the risks posed by the analyzed hazard, proceed in accordance with the 3-step method: 1 Design the machine
so that the risk is eliminated as far as possible. 2 Define, apply, and check the required protective measures. 3 Define how any remaining residual risks can be reduced and provide this information to the user. Technical protective measure • Either of the ISO 13849-1 (PL) or IEC 62061 (SIL) standards can provide assistance with regard to functional safety. • Define the safety functions and determine the required safety level for each. • Draft the safety concept. Select the most effective protective devices and how they will be assembled and integrated into the control system. • Make sure that the protective measures are implemented effectively and that the required safety level is achieved. 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 153 Subject to change without notice 5 – OVERALL VALIDATION 5 – Overall validation As functional safety is only one component of risk reduction, all measures (design and build, technological, and organizational) shall be assessed for their overall effect as part of an overall validation process. Figure 125: Service employee from SICK performing an overall validation of a machine In practice, therefore, it may be the case that an individual technical measure does not reduce risk however a satisfactory result is achieved in the overall context. Sufficient risk reduction can be considered to have been achieved if all of the following questions can be answered with “yes”: • Have all operating conditions in all phases of the machine's life cycle been taken into account? • Was the 3-step method used? • Have the hazards been dealt with or the risks posed by the hazards minimized to the fullest possible practical extent? • Is there an assurance that the measures taken will not result in new hazards? • Have users been given sufficient information about and warning of
the residual risks? • Is there an assurance that the protective measures that have been taken will not impair the working conditions of operating personnel? • Are the protective measures that have been taken compatible with one another? • Has sufficient consideration been given to the possible consequences of using the machine in a non-com‐ mercial or non-industrial environment? • Is there an assurance that the measures taken will not unduly impair the function of the machine as intended? • Has the risk been reasonably reduced? NOTE SICK offers to check the entire machine with regard to significant hazards as part of a safety inspection. This service is performed by the safety specialists at SICK. 154 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 6 – PLACING ON THE MARKET 6 – Placing on the market Once conformity has been ascertained in the context of overall validation (if applicable by involving a notified Body), during the course of the preparation of technical documentation, the declaration of conformity can be issued and the CE marking added to the machine. The declaration of conformity shall take into account all European directives applicable to the machine. Figure 126: Form of the CE marking according to the Machi‐ nery Directive 2006/42 / EC Technical documentation The scope of the technical documentation is described in Annex VII, Section A of the Machinery Directive. For incomplete machines, the particular requirements of Annex VII, Section B of the Machinery Directive apply. Based on the technical documentation, it shall be possible to assess the extent to which the machine meets the requirements of the Machinery Directive. Insofar as is necessary for the purpose of this assessment, the technical documentation shall contain the design, build, and function of the machine. These documents
must be drafted in one or more official European Community languages. This does not apply to the operating instructions of the machine, for which the special provisions of Annex I, Number 1.7.4.1 apply. Retention period and deadlines The technical documentation must be held ready for the responsible authorities of the member states as follows: • From the day of construction of the machine • For at least 10 years following completion of the last unit • The technical documentation does not necessarily have to be physically located in the European Community and also does not need to be in material form (e.g., digital storage is permitted). However, the person designated in the EU declaration of conformity shall be able to make the technical documentation available by a reasonable deadline. NOTE Note: If the technical documentation is not submitted to the competent national authorities upon justified request, this may give rise to doubts! The question may arise: Does the machine in question actually comply with the essential health and safety requirements? NOTE -See also section "Issuing the declaration of conformity", page 14. -See also section "EU conformity assessment procedure for machinery and safety components", page 16.

CEN prepares the European Standards (EN) in non-electrical areas. To prevent these standards representing barri‐ ers to trade, CEN collaborates with ISO. Using a voting procedure, CEN determines whether ISO standards are adopted and publishes them as European standards. CENELEC (Comité Européen de Normalisation Electrotechnique/European Commit‐ tee for Electrotechnical Standardization) CENELEC is the comparable institution to CEN in the area of electrical technology, and prepares and publishes European standards (EN) in this area. CENELEC is increas‐ ingly adopting IEC standards and their numbering system. 18 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice § – LAWS, DIRECTIVES, STANDARDS National standardization organizations and structures As a rule each EU member state has its own standardization organization, e.g., DIN, ON, BSI, AFNOR. These prepare and publish national standards in accordance with the
of safety requirements is something that ought to be taken into account as early as when purchasing a machine. How should machinery be purchased? The procurement process is crucial to the success of a project to build or modernize a production facility. The following points, for example, should be considered: • For complex assemblies of machines, designate a “site manager” in accordance with the Machinery Directive. • Clarify the procedure for the machinery or machine components provided in advance. • Draw up a contract specifying how additional documentation is to be provided (e.g., risk assessment, etc.) so that it will be easier to make changes downstream. • Define, as far as possible, the usage of important standards (harmonized standards in the EU) as the basis. • Agree on a procedure in the event of deviations from harmonized standards. Safety inspections Experience shows that in practice, machine safety is not perfect. Protective devices are often manipulated by the machine operator in order to work without hindrance. Other problems are the incorrect positioning of protective devices and improper integration into control systems. The safety state of work equipment and systems in operation is regulated by EU Directive 2009/104 / EC (“Work Equipment Directive”); it shall be inspected to ensure conformance with applicable national legislation. In particular, Article 4a of the Directive defines the inspection of work equipment. Technical rules, standards or certain regulations can serve as a guide as to how the inspection should be carried out. The user of the respective equipment must perform a risk assessment and is responsible for ensuring that the inspection is carried out and that occupational safety is ensured. In so doing, the user shall ensure that work equipment is inspected in accordance with the national transposition of the Work Equipment Directive to the country of
use. The following requirements must be met: 1 Type of inspection 2 Scope of the inspection 3 Level of detail of the inspection 4 Inspection intervals 5 Level of competence of the inspector A safety inspection by SICK provides you with a fast overview of the safety status of your machines. Parts of SICK's sales organization have already been accredited as an inspection body. Accreditation by an independent body verifies that SICK is capable of carrying out the activities specified in the accreditation scope with a high level of reliability and quality. We discuss potential for improvement with you and work in partnership to realize them. 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 157 Subject to change without notice 🏭 RESPONSIBILITY OF THE USER NOTE Work Equipment Directive, Article 4a Inspection of work equipment 1 The employer shall ensure that where the safety of work equipment depends on the assembly conditions, it shall be subject to an initial inspection (after assembly and before first being put into service) and an inspection after assembly at a new site or in a new location by competent persons within the meaning of national laws and/or practices, to ensure that the work equipment has been assembled correctly and is operating properly. 2 The employer shall ensure that work equipment exposed to conditions causing such deterioration is subject to: ■ Periodic inspections and, where appropriate, testing by competent persons within the meaning of national laws and/or practices; and ■ Special inspections by competent persons within the meaning of national laws and/or practices each time that exceptional circumstances which are liable to jeopardize the safety of the work equipment have occurred, such as modification work, accidents, natural phenomena or prolonged periods of inactivity, in order to ensure compliance with health and safety regulations
and the timely detection and rectification of resulting damage. 3 The results of inspections shall be recorded and kept at the disposal of the authorities concerned. They must be retained for a suitable period of time. When work equipment is used outside the undertaking it shall be accompanied by physical evidence that the last inspection has been carried out. 4 Member States shall determine the conditions under which such inspections are made. Significant modification of machinery Machines usually have a service life of several decades. The further development of technologies and the requirements of the market lead to a continuous improvement of machines and production systems. In many cases, machines are also modified to fit existing production lines and systems. Such modifications may include features and functions that can have a significant impact on the safety of the machine or production line. National regulations may impose specific requirements on the modification of existing machinery, while others are limited to general mandatory clauses for the user (employer). The European Machinery Directive also requires that significantly modified machinery comply with the essential health and safety requirements. The Machinery Directive does not clarify, however, what is to be considered a significant modification. The national European occupational health and safety authorities are given the freedom to define the criteria for a significant modifica‐ tion. The following methodology was developed jointly by industry and occupational health and safety authorities in Germany and has been in use since 2010. General requirements When a machine is modified, the procedure described in the Methodology section must be performed to deter‐ mine if the modification(s) is (are) significant. Legal note: Limiting the risk assessment and reduction to the modified parts and/or zones of the machine may not be sufficient to comply with national legal requirements. Methodology The following steps
must be carried out in the specified order (see figure 127, page 160): Table 59: Steps of the methodology for evaluating significant modifications in machinery Step Description Step 1 Determine if the modifications will result in the occurrence of new hazards. If newly identified hazards result in significant risks, follow Step 3; otherwise, the modifications are considered to be non-substantial. Step 2 If no new hazards have been identified and the modifications do not increase any of the existing risks, the changes are considered non-substantial. If pre-existing risks are increased by the modifi‐ cations, follow Step 3. 158 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 🏭 RESPONSIBILITY OF THE USER Step Description Step 3 The modifications are considered not to be significant if the existing risk reduction measures adequately reduce the risks arising from the new hazards (Step 1) or from the increased risks (Step 2). Otherwise, follow Step 4. Step 4 If the new hazards are eliminated by simple protective devices or by simple integration of additional protective devices, or if the increased risk is adequately reduced, the modifications are considered not to be significant. Otherwise, the modification is considered to be significant. If a modification is considered significant, a risk assessment and risk reduction must be performed in accordance with ISO 12100:2010, but may be limited to those parts and/or zones affected by the modification. Simple protective devices are: • Fixed physical guards or • Movable physical guards, or non-physical guards that do not significantly interfere with the existing safety- related control of the machine. The simple integration of additional protective devices is limited to those that also do not significantly interfere with the existing safety-related parts of control systems (SRP/CS) of the machine: • The signals of the new
protective devices are processed in the existing design of the SRP/CS. • Independent of the existing safety controller, only the safe stop of the dangerous machine function is affected. A non-significant modification is considered to be: • Replacement of components of a machine by identical components or components with an identical function and identical safety level. • Installation of safety devices that result in an increase in the safety level of the machine and do not allow for advanced features or functions. 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 159 Subject to change without notice 🏭 RESPONSIBILITY OF THE USER MODIFICATION NO NO Results in a new hazard?

legal requirements of the respective member states. To provide harmonized health and safety in the European Community and to remove trade barriers, the European standards are adopted by the national standardization organizations. The following principles apply to the relationship between national and safety standards: • If similar national standards exist for adopted European standards, the national standards shall be with‐ drawn. • If no applicable European standards exist for specific aspects or machinery, existing national standards can be applied. • A national standardization organization is only allowed to draft a new national standard if this intention has been announced and there is no interest at European level (at CEN or CENELEC). European standards for machinery safety Standards that describe the requirements of European directives in concrete detail in such a way that compliance with the standards provides presumption of conformity with the directives are referred to as “harmonized stand‐ ards”. The status of the standard is indicated by various abbreviations: • A standard with the prefix “EN” is recognized and can be applied in all EU states. • A standard with the prefix “prEN” is currently in preparation. • A document that also has “TS” as a prefix is a technical specification and is used as a preliminary standard. These documents exist as CLC/TS or as CEN/TS. • A document that also has “TR” as a prefix is a report on the state of the art. A harmonized European standard is prepared as follows: 1. The EU Commission, as the executive organ of the EU, issues a mandate to CEN or CENELEC to draft a European standard to specify in detail the requirements of a directive. 2. The preparatory work is undertaken in international technical committees in which the technical specifica‐ tions to meet the essential safety requirements in the

directive(s) are defined. 3. Once the standard has been approved by the responsible technical committee in a final vote, it is reviewed by the European Commission to determine whether the requirements contained in the standard sufficient to fulfill the requirement of Annex I of the Machinery Directive listed in its Annex ZA. Annex ZA may list one, several or all of the essential health and safety requirements. 4. If the European Commission considers that the standard adequately supports the relevant requirements of Annex ZA, the standard is listed in the Official Journal of the European Union as a harmonized standard. NOTE • A harmonized European standard is used as a reference and replaces all national standards on the same subject. • The compliance of a safety component or a machine with the applicable harmonized standards provides presumption of conformity with the essential health and safety requirements defined in directives, e.g., in the Machinery Directive. NOTE A list of the standards with presumption of conformity with the directives is available at ec.europa.eu. 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 19 Subject to change without notice § – LAWS, DIRECTIVES, STANDARDS NOTE • The application of standards, independent of whether they are harmonized or not, is not a requirement of the Machinery Directive. However, if harmonized standards are applied, the so-called “presumption of conformity” applies, according to which it is assumed that the machine meets the relevant essential safety and health requirements of the Machinery Directive. • If a type-C standard exists for a machine type, it takes precedence over type-A and type-B standards. In this case, only the type-C standard applied justifies the presumption of conformity for meeting the requirements of the Machinery Directive.

European directives. • The application of harmonized standards provides the “presumption of conformity”, i.e., the presumption the machine meets the requirements of the directive. In other words, if you select and apply the right standards for your machine or system, you can assume that you will meet the legal requirements. In specific cases the obligations on the manufacturer can go beyond the content of the standards if, for example, a standard no longer reflects the state of the art. • There are type-A standards (basic safety standards), type-B standards (generic safety standards), and type-C standards (standards on the safety of machinery). If a type-C standard exists, it has priority over the type-A or type-B standard. Test bodies, insurance providers and market surveillance Test bodies Test bodies providing safety advice Companies that want to know whether their machines are compliant with the applicable European directives and standards can obtain advice on safety aspects. Accredited test bodies Accredited test bodies are test bodies that certify compliance with the test procedures and test criteria from recognized national institutions. These test bodies may include institutions for occupational safety and health which generally employ highly competent specialists. Notified bodies Each EU member state has the obligation to nominate test bodies as per the minimum requirements defined in the Machinery Directive, and to notify the European Commission in Brussels of these test bodies for listing. Only these test bodies are authorized to perform EU-type examinations and to issue EU type examination certifi‐ cates for the machinery and safety components listed in Annex IV of the Machinery Directive. Not all notified test bodies can test every type of product or machine. Many test bodies are only notified for specific areas. Insurance providers Berufsgenossenschaften (statutory OSH insurance bodies)/IFA – Institute for Occupational Safety and Health of the German
Social Accident Insurance In Germany, the Berufsgenossenschaften and other organizations cover the legal accident insurance obligation. The Berufsgenossenschaften are organized by branches so that specific requirements in the individual sectors of the economy can be better met. 20 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice § – LAWS, DIRECTIVES, STANDARDS Insurance companies Many insurance companies have departments that offer expert specialist advice, particularly in relation to the prevention of liability risks that may result from ignorance or failure to comply with legal requirements. Market surveillance In the states of the EU and EFTA, work safety and market surveillance are the responsibility of national authorities. • In Germany, this is the responsibility of the “Länder” agencies for occupational health and safety. • Austria has a range of occupational safety inspectorates. Machine manufacturers can also contact national authorities for expert advice in relation to questions about the safety of machinery and safety at work. • In Switzerland, market supervision is the responsibility of the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO). The Swiss National Accident Insurance Fund (Suva), noted for its high levels of technical expertise, is responsible for enforcement.

The process of risk assessment supports the machine manufacturer in this task. A risk assessment is a sequence of logical steps that facilitate the systematic analysis and evaluation of risks. The results of the risk assessment must be taken into
account when designing and constructing the machine (risk reduction). The risk assessment should help to reduce or avoid risks. As a consequence it may identify necessary measures to protect the operator from hazards. If necessary, the risk assessment process must be repeated several times. The first process steps are intended to identify and assess hazards. This is followed by an evaluation and, if necessary, risk mitigation. If the measure triggers a new hazard, the repeated risk assessment reveals this. Being machine-related and application-specific, the risk assessment is already specified in many type-C standards. If this is not the case or not applicable, the requirements of the type-A and type-B standards can be used.

It must be repeated (iterative process) until the remaining residual risk is acceptably low. • The results achieved during the risk assessment and the procedure applied shall be documented. Functions of the machine (definition of limits) The risk assessment starts with the definition of the functions of the machine. These may include: 22 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 1 – RISK ASSESSMENT • The specification for the machine (what is produced, maximum production performance, materials to be used) • Physical limits and expected location • Planned service life • The intended functions and operating modes • The malfunctions and disruptions to be expected • The people involved
in the machine process • The products related to the machine • Intended use but also the unintentional actions of the operator or the reasonably foreseeable misuse of the machine Reasonably foreseeable misuse Reasonably assumable, unintentional actions of the operator or foreseeable misuse may include: • Loss of control of the machine by the operator (particularly on hand-held or portable machinery) • Reflex actions by individuals in the event of a malfunction, a fault, or a failure during the use of the machine • Human error due to lack of concentration or carelessness • Human error due to the selection of the “path of least resistance” in the performance of a task • Actions under pressure to keep the machine in operation whatever happens • Actions by certain groups of people (e.g., children, youths, the disabled) Expected malfunctions and faults There is significant potential for hazards due to malfunctions and faults in the components relevant to functional‐ ity, in particular components of control systems. Examples: • Reversing of a roller movement (with the result that hands are drawn in) • Movement of a robot outside its programmed working area Identification of hazards After defining the function of the machine comes the most important step in the risk assessment on the machine. This step comprises the systematic identification of foreseeable hazards, hazardous situations, and/or hazardous events.

This is determined by: The exposure of a person/persons to the hazard ° The occurrence of the hazardous event ° The technical and human possibilities for the prevention or limitation of harm ° There are a variety of tools available for assessing risks, e.g., tables, risk graphs, numerical methods. Based on the
results of the risk estimation, the risk assessment determines whether the application of protective measures is required and when the necessary risk reduction has been achieved. NOTE - Tools and tables: Technical Report – ISO/TR 14121-2 Scalable Risk Analysis and Evaluation Method (SCRAM) The method is used to evaluate the initial risk and to estimate the risk after applying inherently safe design measures. It also assists with estimating the effectiveness of the implemented technical protection measures and/or the information for use. This method, developed by SICK on the basis of ISO 12100, has proven itself over many years through its practicality, plausibility, and reliability in preventing errors. All 3 levels of risk reduction (3-step method) are considered by SCRAM: • Safe design • Technical protective measures • Information for use 24 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 1 – RISK ASSESSMENT table 3 and table 5 on the following pages provide the basic framework for SCRAM. table 3 makes it possible to consider both the extent of the damage and the probability of occurrence of that damage. The risk elements used in SCRAM include: • the severity of the injury • the exposure of the person to the hazard • the possibility of avoiding the hazard • the probability of occurrence of the hazard Table 3: SCRAM, Step 1 (main table for determining the risk index) Occurence Severity Exposure Avoidance O1 – O3 O1 O2 O3 E0 ÷ < 1 S1 E1 – E3 A1, A2 < 1 < 1 < 1 E0 ÷ ≤ 1 A1 < 1 < 1 1 E1 A2 < 1 1 1 S2 A1 1 2 2 E2 A2 1 2 2 A1 2 3 3 E3 A2 2 3 3 E0 ÷ 1 A1

The result is a so-called risk index. This is mapped to the safety levels of ISO 13849-1 (PL) and IEC 62061 (SIL) (see table 4, page 26). A separate risk estimation in accordance with ISO 13849-1, Annex A is not required when using SCRAM. 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 25 Subject to change without notice Table 4: Correspondence of the SCRAM risk index to the required safety level Risk index < 1 1 2 – 3 4 – 7 8 – 10 PLr a b c d e (ISO 13849-1) SIL ÷ 1 2 3 (IEC 62061) The table 5 allows the estimation of the effectiveness of the implemented technical protective measures and/or information for use provided.

This task is simplified by the pre-defined list of hazards, the CE management software from ibf for structured risk assessment, and the scheme for evaluating both the risk and the level of safety necessary in control systems. The necessary standards are always kept up to date with the StandardManager and the update assistants. The hazards are evaluated separately at each hazardous point and for each phase of the machine’s life cycle. Evaluating hazards individually enables the ideal measures for risk reduction to be selected in each case. Safexpert® uses a combination of risk graphs and matrices (tables). The estimation is made before (IN) and after (OUT) the protective measure (e.g., protective device) has been selected. The risk is categorized on a scale from 0 (no risk) to 10 (highest risk). 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 27 Subject to change without notice 1 – RISK ASSESSMENT Figure 12: Risk graph for evaluating hazards using the Safexpert® software from ibf NOTE Safexpert® is not only used for risk assessment. Using Safexpert®, every aspect of the conformity process according to the Machinery Directive can be completed and documented efficiently. Summary: Risk assessment General • Perform a risk assessment for all hazards. This iterative process must take into account all hazards and risks until there are no residual risks or only acceptable residual risks remain. Risk assessment process • Start the risk assessment by establishing the functions and the limits of
the machine. • During the risk assessment, take into account in particular reasonably foreseeable misuse and malfunctions. • Then identify the hazards (mechanical, electrical, thermal,etc.) derived from the operation of the machine. Take into account these hazards in all life phases of the machine. • Then estimate the risks derived from the hazards. These depend on the extent of harm and the probability of occurrence of the harm. • Document the results of your risk assessment. 28 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice RISK REDUCTION STRATEGY Risk reduction strategy If the risk assessment shows that measures are required to reduce the risk, the 3-step method shall be used. The 3-step method The machine manufacturer must apply the following principles in the specified order when selecting risk reduction measures: 1 Safe design: elimination or minimization of residual risks as far as possible (integration of safety in the design and construction of the machine) 2 Technical protective measures: Take the necessary protective measures against risks that cannot be elimi‐ nated by design 3 Information for use about residual risks Safe design End or next Start (inherently safe design) hazard Has the risk Yes been reasonably reduced?

are excluded by design. Safe design is therefore the most effective approach. Aspects of safe design relate to the machine itself and the interaction between the person at risk and the machine. Examples: • Mechanical design • Operating and maintenance concept • Electrical equipment (electrical safety, EMC) • Strategies for emergency stop in an emergency situation • Equipment involving fluids • Materials and resources used • Machine function and production process All components should be selected, applied and adapted in such a way that the safety of persons is maintained in the event of a machine error. The prevention of harm to the machine and the environment shall also be considered. All elements of the machine shall be designed to operate within the specified limits. The design should be as simple as possible. Safety-related functions shall be separated from other functions as far as possible. Mechanical design The following measures are examples of how mechanical design can prevent the arising of hazards: • Avoiding sharp edges, corners, and protruding parts • Avoiding crushing points, shearing points, and entanglement points • Limiting kinetic energy (mass and speed) • Considering ergonomic principles Correct Incorrect refrödueN :ecruoS Figure 14: Example: Avoiding shearing points The distance e should be ≤ 6 mm! The angle E should be ≥ 90°! refrödueN :ecruoS 2 SAFE DESIGN (INHERENTLY SAFE DESIGN) e Figure 15: Avoiding entanglement points NOTE - Alfred Neudörfer: Konstruieren sicherheitsgerechter Produkte, Springer-Verlag, Berlin u. a., ISBN 978-3-662-62703-7 (8th edition 2020) 30 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 2 SAFE DESIGN (INHERENTLY SAFE DESIGN) Operating and maintenance concept The need for exposure to the hazard should be kept as low as possible. This can be achieved, for example, by: • Automatic loading and unloading stations • Setup
and maintenance work from the “outside” • Use of reliable, available components to prevent maintenance work • Clear and unambiguous operating concept, for example grouping operating elements according to related functions (e.g., for setup operation) Color marking Manual control devices, indicators and information displayed on monitors shall be color-coded. The various colors have different meanings.

It is necessary to distinguish between two types of hazard: • Hazards arising from electrical power, i.e., hazards due to direct or indirect contact • Hazards arising from situations indirectly due to errors in the control system NOTE - In the following sections you will find important information on the design of the electrical equipment. - Electrical equipment of machines: IEC 60204-1 Power supply connection The electrical power supply connection is the interface between the electrical equipment in the machine and the supply grid. The regulations of the respective electricity grid operator on the connection must
be observed. A stable power supply is particularly important in safety-related applications. For this reason, the power supply should be able to bridge brief power outages. 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 31 Subject to change without notice 2 SAFE DESIGN (INHERENTLY SAFE DESIGN) Earthing system The earthing system characterizes both the type of connection on the secondary side of the supply transformer to earth and the type of earthing for the electrical equipment’s chassis. Three earthing systems are standardized internationally: • TN system • TT system • IT system Earthing is an electrically conductive connection to the earth. A differentiation is made between protective earthing (PE), which is related to electrical safety, and functional earthing (FE), which is used for other purposes. The protective conductor system comprises earth electrodes, connecting cables, and the related terminals. For equipotential bonding, all conductive and accessible parts of the machine must be connected to the protective conductor system. Equipotential bonding is a basic means of protection in the event of a fault. Table 7: Protective conductor system for different earthing systems L1 L2 L3 N PE Fuse Wire marking Protective conductor connection Housing Equipotential bonding bar Mains disconnection device TN system The TN system is the most common form of network in low voltage systems. In the TN system, the star point of the transformer is directly connected to earth (system earthing). The chassis of the equipment connected are connected to the transformer’s star point via the protective conductor (PE). Depending on the wire cross-section laid, PE and N conductors are laid as a common conductor (TN-C system) or as two independent conductors (TN-S system). TT system In a TT system, the star point of the supply transformer is earthed in the same way as in a TN system.
The protective conductor connected to the electrically conductive equipment housing is not connected to this star point, but is earthed separately. The chassis of the equipment can also be earthed using a common protective earth electrode. TT systems are usually only used in connection with residual current circuit breakers. The advantage of the TT system lies in its increased reliability for remote areas. IT system The conductive housings of the equipment in an IT system are earthed in the same way as in a TT system, but the star point of the feeding transformer is not. Systems in which a shutdown will result in a hazardous situation and which should therefore not be shut down yet in the event of a single short-circuit or earth fault are designed as IT systems. In the low-voltage area, IT systems are required, for example, to supply operating rooms and intensive care stations in hospitals. 32 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 2 SAFE DESIGN (INHERENTLY SAFE DESIGN) NOTE - Protective measures: Basic standard IEC 61140 and IEC 60364-4-41 with varying national amendments. Mains disconnection device According to IEC 60204-1, a mains disconnection device must be provided for every power supply connection to one or more machines. It must be able to isolate the electrical equipment from the power supply. The following disconnection devices can be used for this purpose: • Power circuit breaker for use category AC-23B or DC-23B • Isolating switch with auxiliary contact for leading load shedding • Circuit breaker • Plug/socket combination up to 16 A / 3 kW Certain circuits such as control circuits for interlocking functions do not need to be shut down by the isolation device. In this case special precautions must be taken to ensure the safety
of operators. Power isolation to prevent unexpected start-up When working on the machine (maintenance, cleaning, servicing, etc.), a machine start or the restoration of power shall not result in a hazard for the persons involved. When mains disconnection devices are used, means shall be provided to prevent unintentional and/or mistaken switching of the power supply isolation device. This can be achieved, for example, by blocking the main switch in the “OFF” position with a padlock. NOTE This power isolation device is not suitable for use as a protective measure for brief interventions into the hazard‐ ous area for operational purposes. Protection against electric shock Protection classes The classification into different protection classes describes the means by which single-fault safety is achieved. This categorization does not provide an indication of the level of protection. Table 8: Symbols and explanations of protection classes Protection class I All devices with simple insulation (basic insulation) and a protective conduction connection are in protection class I. The protective conductor must be connected to a terminal marked with the earthing symbol or PE and be green-yellow. Protection class II Equipment in protection class II has increased insulation or double insulation and is not connected to the protec‐ tive conductor. This protective measure is also known as protective insulation. There shall be no connection of a protective conductor. Protection Class III Equipment in protection class III operates with a safety extra-low voltage and, therefore, does not require any explicit protection. Safety extra-low voltage SELV/PELV AC voltages up to 50 volts (V ) and DC voltages up to 120 volts are allowed as safety extra-low voltages. Above RMS 75 volts DC, the requirements of the Low Voltage Directive must also be observed. 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 33 Subject to change without notice
2 SAFE DESIGN (INHERENTLY SAFE DESIGN) In the case of applications in normally dry rooms, it is not necessary to provide protection against direct contact (basic protection) if the rms value of the AC voltage does not exceed 25 V or the harmonic-free DC voltage does not exceed 60 V. A harmonic-free state exists when the DC voltage is superimposed with a sinusoidal AC voltage component of no more than 10% effective. The safety extra-low voltage circuit shall be safely separated from other circuits (adequate air and creepage distances, insulation, connection of circuits to the protective conductor, etc.). Two safety extra-low voltages are distinguished: • SELV (safety extra-low voltage) • PELV (protective extra-low voltage) NOTE A safety extra-low voltage shall not be generated from the mains using autotransformers, voltage dividers, or series resistors.

Stop categories according to IEC 60204-1 Safety-related and function-related aspects in machines result in stop functions in various categories. Stop catego‐ ries shall not to be confused with the categories according to ISO 13849-1. Table 11: Stop categories according to IEC 60204-1 Stop category 0 Supply of power to the drive elements is isolated (uncontrolled stopping) Stop category 1 Machine is placed in a safe state, only then the supply of power to the drive elements is isolated Stop category 2 Machine is placed in a safe state but the supply of power to the drive elements is not disconnected NOTE - See also section "Emergency stop", page 49. NOTE - Stop categories, see “Electrical equipment of machines: IEC 60204-1”. Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) Electromagnetic compatibility is “the ability of a device, unit of equipment or system to function satisfactorily in its electromagnetic environment without introducing intolerable electromagnetic disturbances to anything in that environment”. The machine and the components used
shall be selected and verified so that they can withstand or are immune to the expected disturbances. Increased requirements apply to safety components. Electromagnetic disturbances can arise from the following causes: • Fast, transient, electrical disturbances (burst) • Surge voltages, e.g., caused by lightning strikes to the grid • Electromagnetic fields • High-frequency disturbance (neighboring cables) • Electrostatic discharge (ESD) The limits for interference immunity and interference emission are different for industrial and residential applica‐ tions. More stringent requirements apply to components in the industrial sector. On the one hand they must withstand stronger disturbances, but on the other hand they are allowed to interfere more strongly. Components that meet the RF interference requirements in the industrial sector may cause RF interference in residential areas. The following table shows examples of the typical interference immunity in a number of areas of application, in each case in the frequency range from 900 to 2 000 MHz.

The generic term is used because liquids and gases behave similarly. Fluid technology describes processes and systems for the transmission of power using fluids in closed pipe systems. Subsystems Every fluid-related system comprises the following subsystems: • Compressing: compressor/pump • Conditioning: filters • Pumping: pipework/hoses • Controlling: valve • Driving: cylinder Pressure is established in any fluid-related system by pumping the fluid against loads. If the load increases, the pressure also increases. Fluid technology is applied in engineering in hydraulics (energy transmission using hydraulic oils) and in pneumat‐ ics (energy transmission using compressed air).
| Guide for Safe Machinery 5 Subject to change without notice FOREWORD Foreword Figure 1: Machine safety inspection Safe machines increase legal certainty for the manufacturer and user. Machine operators expect to be offered only safe machinery or devices. This expectation exists worldwide. There are also regulations on the protection of operators of machinery worldwide. Such regulations are different depending on countries and regions. However, there is broad agreement on the process to be applied during the manufacture and upgrade of machinery: During the design and manufacture of machinery, the machine manufacturer shall identify and evaluate all possible hazards and hazardous points by undertaking a risk assessment. Based on this risk assessment, the machine manufacturer shall take suitable design measures to eliminate or reduce the risk. If the risk cannot be eliminated by these design measures or the remaining risk is not tolerable, the machine manufacturer shall select and apply suitable protective devices, and provide information on the residual risks if necessary. To ensure the intended measures work correctly, overall validation is necessary. This overall validation shall evaluate the design and technical measures, as well as the organizational measures in context. About this guide What does the guide contain? You have before you a comprehensive guide on machine safety requirements and on the selection and use of protective devices. We will show you various ways in which you can safeguard machinery and protect persons against accidents taking into account the applicable European directives, regulations, and standards. The exam‐ ples and statements given are the result of our many years of practical experience and are to be considered typical applications. 6 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice For better orientation and guidance through the guide, § we have divided the path to
Oil-based hydraulics required a circuit for the fluid (feed and return), while in pneumatics the exhaust air is discharged to the environment using acoustic attenuators. Design principles The basic principles for the safe application of fluid technology are described in ISO 4413 (hydraulics) and ISO 4414 (pneumatics). All parts of a fluid-related system are to be protected against pressures that exceed the maximum operating pressure of a subsystem or the rated pressure of a component. A danger shall not be caused by leaks in a component or in the pipework/hoses. Acoustic attenuators are to be used to reduce the noise caused by escaping air. The use of acoustic attenuators shall not produce any additional hazard; acoustic attenuators shall not cause any harmful back-pressure. 38 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 2 SAFE DESIGN (INHERENTLY SAFE DESIGN) Use in potentially explosive atmospheres Protection against explosions is a particularly safety-related task. People are placed at risk in the event of an explosion, e.g., due to uncontrolled radiation of heat, flames, pressure waves, and flying debris, as well as due to harmful reaction products and the consumption of the oxygen in the ambient air necessary for breathing. Explosions and fires are not among the most common causes of industrial accidents. They often result, however, in serious injuries and death as well as major economic damage. Where dust, flammable gases, or liquids are manufactured, transported, processed, or stored, a potentially explo‐ sive atmosphere may be produced, i.e., a mixture of fuel and atmospheric oxygen within the limits for explosions. If a source of ignition is present, an explosion will occur. 100 vol. % Oxygen concentration vol. % Mixture too lean: Explosive Mixture too rich: No self-ignition atmosphere No explosion Explosion limits 0 vol. % Concentration

Stopping • Plan a control device for stopping the machine in normal operation. EMC • Design machines that meet applicable EMC requirements. The components used must be selected and verified so as to meet the following criteria: Comply with electromagnetic disturbance limits to not interfere with other equipment or devices ° Ensure immunity to the expected disturbances ° Comply with limit values for the area of application ° 40 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 3 – TECHNICAL PROTECTIVE MEASURES 3 – Technical protective measures A technical protective measure is implemented by means of one or more safety functions. Each safety function comprises at least one protective device. There are three types of protective devices: • Mechanical protective devices that retain parts, substances, or radiation or permanently prevent entry/ access. • Protective devices that are integrated into the controller of the machine to initiate the safe state as soon as persons or parts of the human body are detected. • Protective devices that are integrated into the controller of the machine to initiate the safe state as soon as the monitored safety-related limits of machine parameters (position, speed, force, etc.) are exceeded. All these protective devices implement safety functions, but not
every protective device has to be integrated into the machine controller for this purpose. Fixed physical guards (fences, barriers, covers), for example, are not integrated into the machine controller but if designed correctly, such guards fulfill the requirement of the safety function. Functional safety When protective devices are integrated into the machine controller, the risk reduction relies on the correct functioning of the controller. In this case, we refer to this as functional safety. When implementing functional safety, the required safety level must be determined for each safety function. The requirements of each particular protective measure must be implemented using suitable components. Validation The validation of all technical protective measures ensures that the safety functions reliably reduce the risk. The design of technical protective measures and safety functions and the methodology for their implementation in the control system form the content of the next chapter (sub-steps 3a to 3e). 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 41 Subject to change without notice 3 – TECHNICAL PROTECTIVE MEASURES Definition of the safety functions Determination of the required safety level Design the safety function Technology, selection and use of protective devices Positioning and sizing of protective devices Integration of protective devices in the control system Verification of the safety functions Validation of all safety functions Figure 18: From definition to validation of the safety functions 42 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 3A – DEFINING THE SAFETY FUNCTIONS 3a – Defining the safety functions The safety functions describe how risks are reduced by protective measures. At least one safety function must be defined for each hazard that has not been eliminated by the design. It is necessary to precisely describe the safety function in order to achieve the required safety
with reasonable effort. The type and number of components required for the function are derived from the definition of the safety function. NOTE - Examples for the definition of safety functions: IFA Report 2/2017, “Functional safety of machine controls” Permanently preventing entry/access Access to a hazardous point is prevented by means of mechanical covers, barriers, or obstacles (referred to as physical guards). Examples: • Prevention of direct access to hazardous points using covers (see figure) • Distancing protective devices (e.g., tunnels) to pre‐ vent access to the hazardous points and allow the passage of materials or goods (see figure) • Prevention of access to hazardous areas using physical guards Figure 19: Preventing access to the hazardous point in a packaging machine by means of a tunnel 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 43 Subject to change without notice 3A – DEFINING THE SAFETY FUNCTIONS Temporarily preventing access Access to a hazardous point is prevented until the machine is in a safe state. Examples: • On request, a machine stop is initiated. When the machine reaches the safe state, the blocking of access by the safety locking device is released. • After disconnecting the power, a transfer key that allows access (opening the movable physical guard) is enabled. Figure 20: Temporarily preventing access to the hazardous point in a stretch film wrapper by means of a safety locking device Retaining parts/substances/radiation If parts can be ejected out of machines or radiation can arise, mechanical protective devices (physical guards) must be used to prevent these hazards. Examples: • Protection hood with special viewing window on a milling machine to protect against ejected shav‐ ings and tool parts • Fence that can hold back a robot Figure 21: Retention of shavings in a processing machine by means of a
protection hood 44 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 3A – DEFINING THE SAFETY FUNCTIONS Initiating a stop The purpose of a safety-related stop function is to place the machine in a safe state when requested (e.g., if a person approaches). To reduce the required stopping time, it may be advisable to implement a stop function that complies with stop category 1 (IEC 60204-1 "Stop‐ ping", page 35). Additional safety functions may be nec‐ essary to prevent an unexpected restart. Examples: • Opening a protective door with an interlock that has no locking device • Interruption of the light beam of a safety light- beam sensor that protects against access Figure 22: Initiating a stop by a safety multibeam sensor on a pallet handling machine when a person approaches Avoiding an unexpected start-up After the “Initiating a stop” function is triggered or the machine is switched on, it should require deliber‐ ate actions to put the machine into operation. These actions include manually resetting a protective device to prepare for restarting the machine (see also section "Application of reset and restart", page 110) Examples: • Resetting a safety light curtain (see figure: blue “Reset” button) • Resetting the emergency stop device Figure 23: Avoiding the unexpected start-up by deliberate resetting the safety light curtain 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 45 Subject to change without notice 3A – DEFINING THE SAFETY FUNCTIONS Preventing start After the “Initiating a stop” function, technical meas‐ ures should be used to prevent the machine from start‐ ing or being put back into operation as long as there are persons in the hazardous area. Examples: • Use of a trapped key system: Restoration of power is only possible using the transfer key.
The transfer key is only available when the means of access (movable physical guard) is closed and locked. • Detection in the active protective field of a horizon‐ tally arranged safety light curtain. The “Initiating a stop” function is implemented by means of the vertical protective field of the safety light curtain. Figure 24: Preventing start-up by means of a horizontal safety light curtain Combination of initiating a stop/preventing start Restart is prevented using the same protective device that initiates the stop as long as there are persons or parts of the body in the hazardous area. Examples: • A two-hand control on single-person workplaces • Use of a safety light curtain so that standing behind or reaching around is not possible (hazard‐ ous point protection) • Use of a safety laser scanner for area protection Figure 25: Initiating a stop and preventing start using a safety laser scanner (hazardous area monitoring) 46 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 3A – DEFINING THE SAFETY FUNCTIONS Allowing material passage To move materials in or out of the hazardous area, spe‐ cific features of the materials moved are used for mate‐ rial detection or to automatically differentiate between material and people. The protective device is then not actuated during material transport; however, people are detected. Examples: • Selecting suitable sensors and placing them in appropriate positions enables the material to be detected and the safety function to be tempora‐ rily suspended while the material passes through (muting). • Protective field switching on a safety laser scanner • Horizontal light curtains with integrated algorithm for human-material differentiation Figure 26: Access monitoring and allowing a car body to be transferred through a horizontal safety light curtain with inte‐ grated human-material differentiation NOTE - For more
detailed information, see section see "Automatic material passage using ESPE", page 78. Monitoring machine parameters In some applications, it is necessary to monitor various machine parameters for safety-related limits. If a limit is exceeded, suitable measures are initiated (e.g., stop, warning signal). Examples: • Monitoring of speed, temperature, or pressure • Position monitoring for collision avoidance Figure 27: Monitoring the robot position using an inductive proximity sensor 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 47 Subject to change without notice 3A – DEFINING THE SAFETY FUNCTIONS Safeguarding work areas shared by humans and machines If the operation of a machine requires a workspace to which both a worker and hazardous parts of the machine (e.g., a robot) need access at different times, it must be ensured that any contact or collision is avoided. Additional safety functions may be necessary to avoid an unexpected restart. Figure 28: Safeguarding a shared work area for humans and robots using safety light curtains Disabling safety functions manually and for a limited time If it is necessary for setup work or process monitoring to operate the machine with the protective function of the protective devices disabled, a suitable operat‐ ing mode should be provided that meets the following requirements: • Operating mode is only activated when an operat‐ ing mode selector switch is in the corresponding position. • Operating mode locks all other control and operat‐ ing modes of the machine. • Operating mode does not allow machine move‐ ments due to direct or indirect action on sensors or linked sequences. • Operating mode allows dangerous machine func‐ tions only while command devices (e.g., enabling switch) are continuously actuated and under reduced risk conditions (e.g. limitation of speed, movement path, function duration).

Within this context, different safety measures may be effective or different safety functions may be coupled together. The process of switching between operating modes, or the selection and adjust‐ ment of different safety measures, is not allowed to lead to a dangerous state. When combining or changing safety functions, an appropriate safety level must also be determined and implemented. Examples: • After a change of operating mode between setup and normal operation, the machine is stopped. A new manual start command is necessary. • Adapting the monitored area of a safety laser scanner according to the vehicle speed Figure 30: Adapting the monitored area of a safety laser scanner according to the vehicle speed Emergency stop Emergency stop is a complementary protective meas‐ ure and not a protective device.

These kind of signals can also be used to
warn the operator before automatic protective measures are initiated. The following should be noted: • Warning devices must be designed and arranged so that they can easily be checked and inspected. • The information for use shall include the prescrip‐ tion of the regular inspection of warning equip‐ ment. • Sensorial saturation should be avoided, in particu‐ lar where audible alarms are concerned. Examples: • Interlocking indications • Startup warning devices • Muting lamps Figure 32: Safety-related indications on an autonomous fork‐ lift truck Other functions Safety devices can also perform other functions. The actual safety functions must not be impaired as a result of this.

Two additional chapters describe the regulatory requirements for the machine manufacturer and the requirements for the machine user. 1 Risk assessment This guide describes the legal requirements on the safety of machinery in the European Union and their Safe design implementation. The legal requirements relating to machinery in other regions (e.g., North America, Asia) are described in separate versions of this guide. 3 Technical protective measure It is not possible to derive any claims whatsoever from the following information, irrespective of the legal basis, 4 Information for use as every machine requires a specific solution against the background of national and international regula‐ tions and standards. 5 Overall validation We refer to the latest published standards and direc‐ tives at the time of publishing.

Responsibility of the user – noitcuder ksiR dohtem pets-3 eht FOREWORD 2 Figure 2: Structure: “Six steps to a safe machine” Who is this guide for? This guide is aimed at manufacturers, users, designers, system engineers, and all individuals who are responsible for machine safety. Use of the terms “safety” and “safe” in this document According to ISO Guide 51, "The term “safe” is often understood by the general public as the state of being protected from all hazards. However, this is a misunderstanding: “safe” is rather the state of being protected from recognized hazards that are likely to cause harm”. Some level of risk is inherent in all products or systems (so-called residual risk). Absolute certainty is therefore not possible. In this guide, the terms “safety”
• the power control element(s) If no type-C standard exists for the particular machine or the type-C standard does not contain any requirements relating to this, the required safety level can be determined on the basis of one of the following standards: NOTE - ISO 13849-1 - IEC 62061 By applying these standards it can be ensured that the effort required to reduce the risk is reasonable for the risk that has been determined. The protection of an operator who manually inserts and removes parts at a metal press requires a different risk reduction compared to the protection of an operator who works on a machine on which the maximum risk is the trapping of a finger. Safety functions shall be specified individually for each phase of the machine’s life cycle and hazard, since one and the same machine can have different hazardous points with different risks during different phases of the lifecycle. The risk assessment is based on the following parameters: • The severity of the possible injury/damage to health • Frequency and/or duration of exposure • The possibility of preventing the hazard By combining these parameters, the required safety level can be determined. Some standards contain suitable methods for this determination. The risk assessment always starts without considering risk reduction measures. Required performance level (PLr) according to ISO 13849-1 This standard uses a risk graph to determine the required risk reduction level. The parameters S, F and P are used to determine the magnitude of the risk. The result of the procedure is a “required performance level” (PLr). 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 51 Subject to change without notice Severity of injury Frequency and/or Possibility of avoiding the PLr – required S1: Mild duration of exposure to hazard or limiting the performance level

The performance level depends on the structure of the control system, the reliability of the components used, the ability to detect faults as well as the resistance to common cause faults in multi-channel controllers (see section "Safety-related aspects of subsystems", page 56). In addition, further measures to avoid design faults are required. If the probability of occurrence of a hazardous event can be assessed as low, the PLr may be reduced by one level. This method is described in Annex A of the standard. This annex is informative and not normative. It is not necessary, therefore, to apply the process described there in order to fully comply with the requirements of the standard. The SCRAM method from SICK can also be used as an alternative. The advantage is the universal applicability and the finer granularity of the decision parameters see "Scalable Risk Analysis and Evaluation Method (SCRAM)", page 24. Required safety integrity level (SIL) according to IEC 62061 The procedure used here is a numerical procedure. The severity, the frequency and duration of exposurein the hazardous area, and the probability of avoiding or limiting harm are evaluated. In addition, the probability of occurrence of the hazardous event is taken into consideration. The result is the required safety integrity level (SIL).

The SIL implemented depends on the structure of the control system, the reliability of the components used, the ability to detect faults as well as the resistance to multiple common cause faults in multiple channel control systems. In addition, further measures to avoid design faults are required (see "Safety-related aspects of subsystems", page 56). Summary: Determining the required level of safety General • Define the necessary level of safety for each safety function. • The parameters “severity”, “probability of occurrence” and “probability
of avoiding damage” determine the required safety level. Applicable standards • ISO 13849-1 uses a risk graph to determine the required safety level. The result of the procedure is a “required performance level” (PLr). • ISO 13849-1 is also applicable to hydraulic, pneumatic, and mechanical systems. • IEC 62061 uses a numerical method to determine the required safety level. The result is a required safety integrity level (SIL). 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 53 Subject to change without notice 3c – Designing the safety function Steps 3c and 3d describe the design and verification of the safety functions. These steps may need to be performed several times in an iterative process. Step 3c includes the development of the safety concept, the selection of the protective devices, the integration into the controller, and the verification of the safety function. NOTE During this process it is necessary to repeatedly check whether the selection of the technology offers sufficient safety and is also technically feasible, or whether other risks or additional risks are produced by the use of a specific technology. Safety concept Develop a concept for the required safety functions. A machine or system consists of several components that interact and ensure the functionality of a machine or system. A distinction must be made here between components that perform pure operating tasks and ones that are responsible for safety-related functions.

These parts include sensors, logic units, power control elements, for example, as well as drive and work elements. This selection is usually made while developing the safety concept. A safety function can be implemented using one or more safety-related component(s). Several safety functions can share one or more components. Control systems shall be designed to avoid hazardous situations. It must be possible to start machinery only by voluntary actuation of a control device provided for the purpose. If a machine restart will pose a hazard, then restarting on switching on the supply voltage shall be excluded by technical means. If a machine restart will not pose a hazard, then restarting without operator intervention (automatic restart) is permitted. Subsystems of the safety-related part of a machine control system Event Signal Signal Signal Motion Power control Sensor Logic unit Drive element element The drive elements shall be designed according to “good engineering practice”. They are only part of the safety function if their failure may lead to a hazard (e.g., suspended axes). Subsystems of the safety-related part of a machine control system Figure 35: Subsystems of a machine controller Decisive factors The following features shall be considered when developing the safety concept: • Features of the machine • Features of the surroundings • Human aspects • Features of the
design • Features of protective devices (see "Technology, selection and use of protective devices", page 60) Which protective devices are to be integrated and how they are to be integrated must be defined based on the above features. Features of the machine The following features of the machine shall be considered: • Ability to stop the dangerous movement at any time (if not possible, use guards or impeding devices) • Ability to stop the dangerous movement without additional hazards (if not possible, select different design/ protective device) • Possibility of hazard due to ejected parts (if yes: use physical guards) • Stopping times (knowledge of stopping times is necessary to ensure the protective device is effective) • Possibility of monitoring stopping time/overrun (this is necessary if changes could occur due to aging/wear) Features of the surroundings The following features of the surroundings shall be considered: • Electromagnetic disturbances, radiated interference • Vibration, shock • Ambient light, light interfering with sensors/welding sparks • Reflective surfaces • Contamination (mist, chips) 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 55 Subject to change without notice • Temperature range • Moisture, weather Human aspects The following human aspects shall be considered: • Expected qualification of the machine’s operator • Expected number of persons in the area • Approach speed (K) • Possibility of defeating the protective devices • Reasonably foreseeable misuse Features of the design A safety function is performed by several subsystems. It is always advisable to implement safety functions with certified safety components. Certified safety components will simplify the design process and subsequent verification. It is often not possible to implement a subsystem using only certified safety components that readily provide the level of safety (PL/SIL). In fact, the subsystem frequently has to be assembled from a number of discrete
elements. In this case, the safety level depends on various safety-related aspects, see "Safety-related aspects of subsystems", page 56.

Dual-channel safety-related systems are common in the machine safety sector (see figure below). Each channel can perform the intended safety function. The two channels can be of diverse design (e.g., one channel uses electromechanical components, the other only electronics). Instead of a second equivalent channel, the second channel can also have a pure monitoring function. 56 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice Table 18: Structure of single-channel and dual-channel safety-related systems Single-channel safety-related systems Dual-channel safety-related systems I Input L Output O I1 Input L1 Monitoring O1 signal signal signal Output signal I2 Input L2 Monitoring O2 signal Output signal ssorC nosirapmoc 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION The structure is described in the standard ISO 13849-11) according to the categories described below.

These components should therefore offer a high level of reliability. The higher the reliability, the lower the probability of a dangerous failure. The data for reliability describe the number of random failures during the service life of the components. These values are usually specified as: • B value for electromechanical or pneumatic components. Here, service life is determined by switching 10 frequency. The B value
indicates the number of switching cycles until 10% of components fail. 10 • Failure rate λ (lambda value) for electronic components. The failure rate is often expressed in FITs (Failures In Time). One FIT is one failure per 109 hours. Early failures Random failures, Wear zone constant low failure rate 0 Time Figure 37: Failure rate λ (bathtub curve) Diagnostics for detecting faults Some faults can be detected by diagnostic measures. Diagnostic measures include plausibility monitoring, current and voltage monitoring, watchdog functionality, brief function test. Since all faults cannot always be detected, the degree of fault detection must be defined. A Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) should be performed for this purpose. For complex designs, measures and empirical values from standards provide assistance. Resistance to common cause faults The term common cause fault is used, for example, to refer to both channels failing simultaneously due to interference. Appropriate measures must be taken to prevent this, e.g., isolated cable routing, suppressors, diversity of compo‐ nents. 58 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice I1 Input L1 Monitoring O1 signal Output signal Fault I2 Input L2 Monitoring O2 signal Output signal ssorC nosirapmoc 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION Figure 38: Structure of a dual-channel safety component with a fault Process The process brings the following influencing elements together: • Organization and competence • Design rules (e.g. specification templates, coding guidelines) • Test concept and test criteria • Documentation and configuration management In the safety technology area, a process based on the V-model has proven particularly effective in practice for software (see figure).

They can be fixed or movable. Physical guards include, for example, covers, fences, barriers, flaps and protective doors. Covers and hoods prevent access from all sides. Fences are generally used to prevent full body access while barriers can only prevent unintentional or unconscious access to the hazardous points. The safety function is essential for the design of guards. Must, for example, the physical guard only prevent access, and/or also retain parts and radiation? Examples of ejected parts: • Breaking/bursting tools (grinding wheels, drills) • Emitted materials (dust, chips, slivers, particles) • Blown out materials (hydraulic oil, compressed air, lubricant, materials) • Parts ejected after the failure of a clamping or handling system Examples of radiation sources: • Thermal radiation from the process or the products (hot surfaces) • Optical radiation from lasers, IR or UV sources • Particle or ion radiation • Strong electromagnetic fields, high frequency equipment • High voltages from test systems or systems for

Machine safeguarding in the work process The requirements on the safeguarding of machinery have changed more and more with the increasing use of automation. In the past, protective devices in the manufacturing process were something of a nuisance; for this reason, they were often not used at all. Today, innovative technologies make it easy to integrate protective devices into the manufacturing process. As a result, they are no longer a hindrance for the operator and even help productivity in many cases. For this reason, reliable protective devices that are integrated into the manufacturing process are indispensable. 8 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice FOREWORD Figure 4: Development of a safety concept Safety is a basic need Safety is a basic human need. Studies show that people continuously subjected to stressful situations are more susceptible to psychosomatic illnesses. Even though it is possible to adapt to extreme situations over the long term, they will place a great strain on the individual. It is often said, however, that more “safety” results in lower productivity – the opposite is actually the case: Higher levels of safety result in increased motivation and satisfaction and, as a result, higher productivity.

Damage (breakage or deformation) to a physical guard is permitted in cases in which the risk assessment determines that no hazards will result. General requirements on physical guards • Protective devices (guards) shall be designed to be adequately robust and durable to ensure they withstand the environmental conditions to be expected during operation. The properties of guards shall be maintained during the entire period of use of the machines. • They shall not cause any additional dangers. • It shall not be possible to easily bypass the guards or render them ineffective. • Guards shall not restrict observation of the working process more than necessary, insofar that observation is necessary. • Guards shall be firmly held in place. • They shall be fastened either by systems that can only be opened with tools, or they shall be interlocked with the dangerous movement. • As far as possible, they should not remain in the protective position if unfastened. NOTE - Physical guards: ISO 14120 - Principles for safe machine design: ISO 12100 (type-A standard) Mounting guards Guards that are not removed or opened very often or are only removed or opened for maintenance work shall be fastened to the machine frame so that they can only be removed with tools (e.g., spanner, key). The process to remove them must be similar to a mounting operation and tools must be required. Fastening elements on guards that are disassembled or removed regularly shall be designed so that
they cannot be lost (e.g., captive screws). Other types of fastening such as quick-release fasteners, screws with knobs, knurled screws, and wing nuts are only allowed if the guard is interlocked. Allowed Not permitted Figure 41: Example: Types of fastening for physical guards Movable physical guards Movable guards that need to be opened frequently or regularly without tools (e.g., for setup work) must be functionally linked to the dangerous machine function (interlocking, locking device). The term frequent opening is used, e.g., if the guard is opened at least once during a shift. If hazards are to be expected when a guard is opened (e.g., very long stopping time), locking devices are required. 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 61 Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION Ergonomic requirements to be met by movable physical guards Ergonomic aspects are also significant during the design of protective devices. Guards will only be accepted by employees if they do not hinder setup, maintenance, and other similar activities any more than necessary. Movable physical guards must meet the following ergonomic criteria: • Easy (e.g., one-handed) opening and closing, lifting, or moving • Functional handle • Opened guards should allow convenient access. Mechanical locking of movable physical guards As far as feasible, movable physical guards must be joined to the machine so that they can be securely held in the open position by hinges, guides, etc. Positive-fit mountings are preferred. Friction mountings (e.g., ball fasteners) are not recommended due to their diminishing effectiveness (wear). Table 20: Example: Locking guards Good Possible Interlocking physical guards Physical guards must be interlocked if they have the following characteristics: • Are actuated cyclically or opened regularly (doors, flaps) • Can be removed without tools or easily (e.g., covers) • Protect against
a potentially serious hazard Interlocking means that the opening of the guard is converted into an electrical signal that stops the dangerous movement. Physical guards are normally interlocked using position switches. The interlocking of a physical guard should fulfill the following functions: • The dangerous machine function cannot be initiated with the guard open (missing) (preventing start). • The dangerous machine functions are stopped when the guard is opened (removed) (initiating a stop). The following section describes the essential requirements on interlocking devices associated with physical guards according to ISO 14119. 62 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION There are four types of interlocking device: Table 21: Types of interlocking devices according to ISO 14119 Designation Actuation Actuator SICK product Principle Examples Principle Examples Example i10P Switching cam i10R Type 1 Not coded Turning lever Physical con‐ Mechanical tact, force, pres‐ sure i10H Hinge i16S Shaped actuator (switching rod) Type 2 Coded Key – IME2S Inductive Suitable ferromagnetic materials Magnets, electromagnets MM12 1 Magnetic All suitable materials CM18 1 Type 3 Capacitive Not coded All suitable materials UM12 1 Non-contact Ultrasound All suitable materials WT 12 1 Optical Magnetic Coded magnet RE1/2 Type 4 RFID Coded Coded RFID transponder STR1 Optical Coded optical actuator – 1 These sensors are not designed for safety applications.

DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION Safety switches, position switches and interlocking devices The commonly used term “safety switch” does not appear in the standards because the multitude of technologies and suitable sensor designs for interlocking devices does not allow general requirements to be defined. Regardless of the technology used (mechanical, electrical, pneumatic, hydraulic), the following definitions apply: • An interlocking device consists of an actuator and a position switch. • A position switch consists of an actuator and an output signal element. Depending on the technology of the position switch used and the functional safety requirements, either one or more interlocking devices will be required for a physical guard. Mechanical attachment Reliable mechanical attachment of the position switches and actuators is crucial for their effectiveness. The elements of interlocking devices • shall be fitted such that they are protected against damage due to foreseeable external effects. • shall not be used as a mechanical stop. • shall be secured against unintentional operation and damage by means of their arrangement and design. • shall be secured against unintentional changes in position by their arrangement, design and fastening. secured. If necessary, the switch and the actuating element must be secured by means of positive locking, e.g., with round holes, dowel pins, stops. • shall be protected by their actuation method, or their integration in the control shall be such that they cannot be easily bypassed. • shall be possible to check the switches for correct operation and, if possible, they shall be easily accessible for inspection. Table 22: Example: Mechanical attachment of position switches Correct mounting: The position switch is Incorrect mounting: The position switch Correct mounting: The height of the cam protected by a mechanical stop. is used as a stop. has been matched to the position switch. Positive mechanical actuation or
interlocking arrangement When using mechanical interlocking devices, reliable actuation is important. The use of positive mechanical actuation in an interlocking device ensures that the position switch is actuated when the guard is opened and reduces possibilities for manipulation. Positive mechanical actuation is the forced movement of the mechanical components of the interlocking device (safety switch) through direct contact with mechanical components or with the physical guard (e.g., protective door). 64 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION Table 23: Example: Positive mechanical actuation Safe: Opening the protective door moves the mechanical Faulty design: The position switch may not always open the plunger of the position switch (positive mechanical actuation). safety circuit, e.g., if the plunger is sticking due to incrusta‐ This opens the safety circuit. tions or lubricating oil that has solidified. Source: BG Feinmechanik und Elektrotechnik, BGI 575 Positive opening A contact element is positive-opening if the switching contacts are isolated immediately by a defined movement of the actuating element by non-elastic parts (e.g., springs). The use of positive opening normally closed contacts in position switches with positive mechanical actuation ensures that electrical circuit is still isolated even if the contacts are worn or other electrical faults have occurred. The following requirements also apply where positive-opening mechanical position switches are concerned: • The actuating travel shall be set to suit the positive-opening travel. • The minimum plunger travel specified by the manufacturer shall be observed in order to provide the switching distance required for positive opening. Figure 42: Symbol for positive opening normally closed contacts in accordance with IEC 60947-5-1, Annex K NOTE The use of both redundantly monitored electronic outputs from electro-sensitive position switches is considered equivalent to positive opening. If a type 3
or type 4 interlocking device is the only interlocking device on a physical guard, it must meet the requirements of IEC 60947-5-3. Manipulation prevention When designing interlocking devices, designers shall consider the possible motivation for manipulation of the protective device and foreseeable manipulation into account. Measures to counter manipulation with simple means shall be applied. Simple means include screws, needles, sections of sheet steel, coins, bent wire or the like. Possible means of avoiding simple attempts to manipulate interlocking devices include: • Making interlocking devices difficult to access by using concealed assembly or assembly out of reach • Using position switches with coded actuators • Mounting the elements of the interlocking switches with “one-way” fasteners (e.g., safety screws, rivets) • Manipulation monitoring in the control system (plausibility checks, testing) 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 65 Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION Redundant design The critical failure of an individual safety switch can be caused by manipulation, a mechanical error on the actuator or position switch (e.g., aging), or the effects of extreme ambient conditions (food industry example: stuck roller plunger due to contamination with flour). In particular at higher safety levels it is necessary to use an additional position switch, e.g., with the opposite function to that of the first position switch, and to have both switches monitored by the control system. Example: An injection molding machine with cyclically actuated front protective doors. This application requires two mechanical switches. Table 24: Example: Detection of mechanical faults by means of a diverse redundant arrangement Locking devices Locking devices are devices that prevent guards from opening. They shall be applied if the stopping time of the dangerous machine state is longer than the time a person needs to reach the hazardous area
(safety function "Temporarily preventing access", page 44). Locking devices shall prevent access to hazardous areas until the dangerous machine state has passed. Locking devices are also required if a process shall not be interrupted (process protection only, not a safety function). The figure below shows the possible designs of locking devices.

Mechanical and electrical integration of locking devices The same rules generally apply to locking devices as to interlocking devices. In relation to the principle of positive opening, attention is to be paid to which contacts should be positively opened. Guard signaling contacts indicate when the actuator has been withdrawn, that the guard is open. These contacts may be positive opening, but this is not always required. Auxiliary and escape release, emergency release The risk assessment may show that in the case of a fault or in an emergency situation,
measures are required for freeing personnel trapped in the hazardous area. A distinction must be made between concepts for auxiliary release (using a tool) and for emergency release or escape release (without a tool), as follows: • Emergency release of a locking device Possibility of manually unlocking the locking device without tools from outside the protected area in case of emergency. A locking device with emergency release may be required, for example, to free trapped persons or to fight a fire. • Auxiliary release of a locking device Possibility of manually unlocking the locking device using a tool or a key from outside the protected area in case of malfunction. A locking device with auxiliary release is not suitable for emergency release or escape release of the locking device. • Escape release of a locking device Possibility of manually unlocking the locking device without the use of tools within the protected area in order to leave the area. Locking force required An essential criterion when selecting a locking device is the force required to hold the guard. Annex I of the ISO 14119 standard specifies the maximum force that can be applied to the most commonly used movable physical guards.

Keys must be used to activate specific functions and operating modes, see table 27, page 68. Figure 1: When a key is removed, a stop signal is generated and the dangerous state is stopped. Figure 2: In the safe state (machine stopped), the safety locking device is unlocked and the door can be opened. Figure 3: The service technician takes the key inside the plant. Inside, the inserted key enables the “setup mode” operating mode. Dangerous machine movements can now be made at reduced speed (turning the robot sideways) by means of an enabling switch. Automatic operation is disabled in this situation. The key is then removed again, the service technician leaves the hazardous area, closes the door, and finally reinserts the key into the adapter. The door is locked and automatic operation is now possible again. Table 27: Example: Trapped key system 1 2 3 Fault masking for series connection of interlocking devices with volt-free contacts The ISO 14119 standard and the ISO TR 24119 technical report define, among other things, the requirements for the logical series connection of position switches. The risk of possible “fault masking” in the conventional series connection of the safety switches limits the achievable performance level and makes such series connection impermissible in some applications. Fault masking can occur when switches with volt-free contacts are connected in series.
Since the evaluation unit only evaluates the signals of the complete series, fault detection can be prevented. The fault, e.g. a short-circuit or cross-circuit, is either not detected at all or reset (masked) after detection as a result of the actuation of another 68 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION protective device with a fault-free switch. This means that operation of dangerous machine functions is possible despite the presence of an isolated fault. The accumulation of masked faults may then lead to the loss of the safety function. Example for the development of fault masking If it is assumed that, during foreseeable troubleshooting, one of the movable physical guards (e.g. protective door, maintenance flap) is operated by the machine operator and the fault is masked thereby, the corresponding reduction in the diagnostic coverage DC (fault recognition rate) has to be taken into account. This may lead to the performance level being reduced to PL d or PL c. NOTE For more information, see the special information “Safe series connection” from SICK. Electro-sensitive protective equipment (ESPE) With electro-sensitive protective equipment (ESPE), in contrast to “guards”, protection is not based on the physical separation of persons at risk from the hazard itself. Protection is achieved through temporal separation. As long as there is somebody in a defined area, no dangerous machine functions are initiated, and such functions are stopped if already underway. A certain amount of time, referred to as the “stopping/run-down time”, is required to stop these functions. The ESPE must detect the approach of a person to the hazardous area in a timely manner and depending on the application, the presence of the person in the hazardous area. The international standard IEC 61496-1 defines safety-related
manufacturer and user can be derived from this: Operators and maintenance personnel shall be able to rely on the safety of a machine! Safety is a management task Employers in industry are responsible for their employees as well as for smooth, cost-effective production. Only if managers make safety part of everyday business activities will employees be receptive to the subject. To improve sustainability, experts are therefore calling for the establishment of a wide-ranging “safety culture” in the respective companies. Involvement of the employees results in acceptance It is extremely important that the needs of operators and maintenance personnel are taken into consideration in the planning at concept level. Only an intelligent safety concept matched to the work process and the personnel will result in the required acceptance. 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 9 Subject to change without notice FOREWORD Expert knowledge is required In the European Union, national legal requirements are harmonized by European legislation such as the Machinery Directive. Directives describe general requirements that are specified in more detail by standards. The safety of machinery depends to a large extent on the correct application of such standards. European standards are often also accepted outside the European Union. Implementing all these requirements in practice requires extensive specialist knowledge, application expertise, and many years of experience. 10 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice § – LAWS, DIRECTIVES, STANDARDS § – Laws, directives, standards European directives One of the goals of the European Community is the protection of the health of its citizens both in the private and in the professional sphere. A further goal is the creation of a single market with free movement of goods. In order to achieve such goals, the functioning of the European
requirements for ESPE independent of their tech‐ nology or principle of operation. What are the benefits of electro-sensitive protective equipment? If an operator frequently or regularly has to access a machine and is therefore exposed to a hazard, the use of an ESPE instead of (mechanical) physical guards (covers, safety fencing, etc.) is advantageous thanks to: • Reduced access time (operator does not have to wait for the guard to open) • Increased productivity (time savings when loading the machine) • Improved workplace ergonomics (operator does not have to operate a physical guard) In addition, operators and others alike are protected. Against what hazards does electro-sensitive protective equipment not protect? Since an electro-sensitive protective equipment does not represent a physical barrier, it is not able to protect persons against emissions such as ejected machine parts, workpieces or chips, ionizing radiation, heat (thermal radiation), noise, sprayed coolant and lubricant, etc. Similarly, ESPE cannot be used on machines on which long stopping/run-down times require minimum distances that cannot be achieved. In such cases, physical guards must be used. ESPE technologies Electro-sensitive protective equipment can implement detection of persons through various principles: optical, capacitive, ultrasound, microwaves (radar) and passive infrared detection. In practice, optical protective devices have been proven over many years and in large numbers (see figure 43, page 70). 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 69 Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION Opto-electronic protective devices The most common electro-sensitive protective devices are optoelectronic devices such as: • Safety light curtains and safety light-beam sensors (AOPD: active optoelectronic protective devices) • Safety laser scanners (AOPDDR: active optoelec‐ tronic protective devices responsive to diffuse reflection) • Camera-based protective devices (VBPD: vision based protective devices) Figure 43: Examples of optoelectronic protective devices NOTE An optoelectronic
protective device can be used if the operator is not exposed to any danger of injury due to ejected parts (e.g., splashes of molten material). Safety light curtains and safety light-beam sensors (AOPD) AOPDs are protective devices that use optoelectronic transmission and reception elements to detect persons in a defined two-dimensional area. A series of paral‐ lel light beams (normally infrared) transmitted from the sender to the receiver form a protective field that safeguards the hazardous area. Detection occurs when an opaque object fully interrupts one or more beams. The receiver signals the beam interruption by a signal change (OFF state) to its output signal switching devi‐ ces (OSSDs). These signals from the OSSDs are used to stop the dangerous machine functions. The international standard IEC 61496-2 defines safety requirements for AOPDs. Typical AOPDs include safety single-beam sensors, safety multibeam sensors, and safety light curtains. AOPDs with a detection capability of more than 40 mm are called safety multibeam sensors. They are used to protect access to hazardous areas (see figure 44, page 70). Figure 44: Access protection using a safety multibeam sensor AOPDs with a detection capability of 40 mm or less are called safety light curtains and are used to safeguard hazardous points directly (see figure 45). With both safety multibeam sensors and safety light curtains, rather than all light beams being activated at the same time, they are usually activated and deac‐ tivated in rapid sequence one after the other. This increases resistance to interference from other sour‐ ces of light and increases their reliability accordingly. On state-of-the-art AOPDs, there is automatic synchro‐ nization between sender and receiver through an opti‐ 70 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION cal link. By using
microprocessors, the beams can be evaluated individually. This enables additional ESPE functions to be implemented in addition to the pro‐ tective function itself ("Additional functions of ESPE", page 81). Figure 45: Hazardous point protection using a safety light curtain Safety laser scanners (AOPDDR) AOPDDRs are protective devices that use optoelectronic sender and receiver elements to detect the reflection of optical radiation generated by the protective device. This reflection is generated by an object in a predefined two-dimensional area. Detection is signaled by a signal change (OFF state) to its output signal switching devices (OSSDs). These signals from the OSSDs are used to stop the dangerous machine functions. A safety laser scanner is an optical sensor which monitors a hazardous area on a machine or vehicle by scanning the area around it on a single plane with infrared light beams. The safety laser scanner operates on the principle of optical time-of-flight measurement. The scanner sends very short light pulses (S) while an “electronic stop‐ watch” runs simultaneously. If the light strikes an object, it is reflected and received by the scanner (R). The scanner calculates the distance from the object from the difference between the send and receive times. A uniformly rotating mirror (M) in the scanner deflects the light pulses such that a sector of a circle is covered. Person The scanner then determines the exact position of the object from the measured distance and the angle of rotation of the mirror. Figure 46: Basic structure of a laser scanner 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 71 Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION The area in which object detection leads to trigger‐ ing (protective field) can be configured by the user via a graphical user interface. Modern scanners sup‐ port simultaneous
and separate monitoring of multiple areas by evaluating fields simultaneously and by com‐ municating with the controller through multiple safe cut-off paths. This feature can be used, for example, to adapt the monitored area to the speed of a vehicle. Safety laser scanners use individually emitted pulses of light in precise directions and do not continuously cover the area to be monitored. Resolutions (detection capabilities) up to 20 mm are achieved through this operating principle. With the active scanning principle, safety laser scanners do not need external receivers or reflectors. Safety laser scanners also have to be able to reliably detect objects with extremely low reflec‐ tivity (e.g., black work clothing). The international stand‐ ard IEC 61496-3 states the safety requirements for AOPDDRs. Figure 47: Simultaneous monitoring of multiple protective fields Camera-based protective devices (VBPD) VBPDs are camera-based protective devices and use image capturing and processing technologies for safety detection of persons (see figure 48). Various principles can be used to detect persons, including: • Interruption of the light retro-reflected by a retro- reflector • Travel time measurement of the light reflected by an object • Monitoring of changes from background patterns • Detection of persons based on human characteris‐ tics The various technical specifications (TS) and technical reports (TR) of the IEC 61496-4 series of standards contain the requirements and characteristics of VBPDs. Figure 48: Protecting people when leaning into the hazardous area of a collaborative robot using a 3D vision-based camera system Detection capability (resolution) of optoelectronic protective devices The detection capability is defined as the limit for the sensor parameter that causes the electro-sensitive protec‐ tive equipment (ESPE) to trigger. In practice, this is about the size of the smallest object detected by the ESPE within the defined monitored area (protective field). 72 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide
for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION The detection capability is specified by the manufacturer. In general, the detection capability is determined from the sum of the beam separation and effective beam diameter. This ensures that an object of this size always covers a light beam and is always detected regardless of its position in the protective field. For safety laser scanners (AOPDDR), the detection capability is dependent of the distance to the object, the angle between the individual beams of light (pulse), and the shape and size of the transmitted beam. The reliability of the detection capability is determined by the type classification in the IEC 61496 series of standards (see table 28, page 75). Preventing reflections from AOPDs For AOPDs, the light beam is focused from the sender. The aperture angle of the lens is reduced as far as possible so that disturbance-free operation can even be ensured in the event of minor alignment errors. The same applies to the aperture angle of the receiver (effective aperture angle according to IEC 61496-2). But even for smaller aperture angles, there is the possi‐ bility for light beams from the sender to be deflected from reflective surfaces, thus leading to a failure to detect an object (see figure 49, see figure 50). Therefore, all reflective surfaces and objects (e.g. mate‐ rial containers, reflective floors) have to maintain a min‐ imum distance a from the protective field of the system Figure 49: The person is detected reliably and the dangerous (see table 28, page 75). movement is stopped. This minimum distance a depends on the distance D between the sender and receiver (protective field width). The minimum distance must be maintained on all sides of the protective field. Figure 50: Reflection

There is a danger that the affected AOPD will lose its ability to provide protection (see figure 51). Assembly situations of this kind must be avoided. If this is not possible, suitable measures must be taken to prevent mutual interference (assembly of opaque partitions or reversing the direction of transmission of a system, for example). Type 4 AOPDs either have to have suitable external sender detection and change to a safe state (outputs in OFF state) when affected or have technical means to Figure 51: Mutual interference impedes detection by the prevent interference. Beam coding is normally used so ESPE (S2-R2) and the dangerous movement is not stopped. that the receiver only responds to light beams from the assigned (identically coded) sender (see figure 52).

Types of protection and required detection capability of the ESPE This section describes the types of protection and which parts of the body should be detected by the ESPE. Hazardous point protection with finger or hand detec‐ tion Hazardous point protection is used to detect when a person comes very close to the hazardous point. This allows the smallest minimum distance to be imple‐ mented. This may be necessary for ergonomic oper‐ ation of the machine, e.g., for insertion work on a press, or to keep the space requirement of the machine low. Fingers/hands must therefore be detected, which requires ESPE with a
detection capability up to 40 mm (ISO 13855). If a person can pass the detection zone of the protective device, prevention of unexpected start-up is necessary, e.g., by means of a reset function of the ESPE.

Detection of the largest body part (torso) is sufficient for this purpose. Access protection is particularly suitable for protecting large areas and areas with large access points. A person who has passed the detection zone of the protective device is no longer detected. Access protection there‐ fore always requires prevention of unexpected start-up. Figure 55: Access protection of a machine using safety multi‐ beam sensors and deflector mirrors Hazardous area protection: detection of the presence of a person in the hazardous area Hazardous area protection is used to detect when a person approaches or is present in the hazardous area. This requires detection of the lower limbs or torso. Hazardous area protection is particularly suitable for machines where, for example, the hazardous area can‐ not be fully seen from the position of the reset push‐ button. Hazardous area protection does not require a reset function if the detection zone cannot be exited in the direction of the hazardous point. When entering the hazardous area, the dangerous state of the machine is stopped and starting is prevented.

This requires the detection of the lower limbs. The application may require that people lying down are detected. Mobile hazardous area protection is particularly suita‐ ble for autonomous vehicles (e.g., cranes and forklifts). Figure 57: Mobile hazardous area protection of an autono‐ mous forklift truck using a safety laser scanner Automatic material passage using ESPE The following safety functions can be integrated either in the logic unit or directly in suitable ESPE. Automatic protective field switching When large openings of machines are secured using ESPE, changing the shape of the active protective field can allow the passage of materials or packages with different contours. This prevents persons accessing the hazardous zone above or behind these materials. Some types of ESPE (AOPD) allow preprogrammed protective fields to be activated by external signals. Instead of muting the entire protective device ("Muting", page 79), a suitable (vertical) protective field of the ESPE can be activated during passage. In addition, field switching may also be required if the hazardous zones of machines change dynamically dur‐ ing machine operation, e.g., adapted exclusion zones for industrial robots with different operating cycles or for transfer trolleys when docking at a station.

The directives are kept technology-neutral as far as possible. The Member States then have to implement these directives in their national legislation. The following directives have been published in the area of health and safety at work and machine safety: • The Machinery Directive, which addresses the manufacturers of machines • The Work Equipment Directive, which addresses the users of machines • Additional directives, e.g., Low Voltage Directive, EMC Directive, ATEX Directive Manufacturer Operating entity TFEU Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union Art. 114 Art. 153 Removal of trade barriers in the EU internal market Collaboration between EU states in social issues OSH Framework Directive 89/391 / EEC Low Machinery Product EMC Directive Workplace Use of Work ATEX Voltage Directive Safety 2014/30/EU Directive Equipment Operational Directive Directive Directive 2006/42/EC Directive 89/654/EC 2009/104/EC 1999/92/EC 2014/35/EU 2001/95/EC Use of Personal Protective Health and Safety Signs Equipment Directive at Work Directive 89/656/EC 92/58/EC Occupational Safety Act (ArbSchG) § § Product Safety Act EMC Ordinance on Industrial Safety and Health (BetrSichV) ProdSG Act statuory insurances Regulations (BGV) Rules (BGR) Information (BGI) Employee Protection Act (ASchG) Mandate of the EU Commission Implementation of General Employee Protection Ordinance (AAV) for the creation of safety EN standards Work Equipment Ordinance (AM-VO) standards to CEN/CENELEC without amendment.

a protective device. This is necessary when material must be moved through the protective field of the protective device without stopping the work routine (hazardous state of the machine). It can also be used effectively to optimize the work rou‐ tine if allowed by certain machine states (e.g., muting the function of a safety light curtain during the non-haz‐ ardous upwards movement of a press die, making it easier for the operator to remove workpieces). Muting shall only be possible if the access to the haz‐ ardous point is blocked by the passing material. If it is not possible to stand behind (or pass through) detec‐ tion areas, muting shall only be possible if the machine functions still taking place are not dangerous (e.g., non- dangerous upward stroke of a press). This status is determined by muting sensors or signals. For the muting function, great care is necessary when Figure 59: Muting function with safety light curtain and mut‐ selecting and positioning the muting sensors and con‐ ing sensors on a wrapping machine troller signals used. The following conditions shall be met to implement a safe, standardized muting function: • During muting, a safe state must be ensured by other means, therefore it shall not be possible to access the hazardous area. • Muting shall be automatic, i.e., not manual. • Muting shall not be dependent on a single electrical signal. • Muting shall not be entirely dependent on software signals. • An invalid combination or sequence of muting signals shall not allow any muting state, and it shall be ensured that the protective function is retained. • The muting status shall end immediately after the material has passed through. To improve the quality of differentiation, additional limits, interlockings, or signals can be used including: • Direction of movement of
the material (sequence of the muting signals) • Limiting the muting time • Material request by the machine control • Operational status of the material handling elements (e.g., conveyor belt, roller conveyor) • Material identification by additional properties (e.g., bar code) NOTE - Practical application of ESPE: IEC 62046 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 79 Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION Safety light curtains with entry/exit function Active differentiation between person and machine (entry/exit function) provides other way of moving mate‐ rial into a safeguarded area. Horizontally arranged safety light curtains (AOPDs) are used for this application. Each of their light beams can be evaluated to distinguish the interruption pattern of the material or material carrier (e.g., pallet) from that of a person. By using self-teaching dynamic blanking, as well as other differentiation criteria such as direction of move‐ ment, speed, entry and exit in the protective field, etc., a safety-relevant distinction can be made. In this way, undetected entry into the hazardous area by anyone can be reliably prevented (see figure 60). Figure 60: Entry/exit function with horizontally installed safety light curtain in a processing station on an automobile assem‐ bly line Safety laser scanner with protective field switching Another way of moving material into a protected area is to actively switch protective fields. As an alternative to active protective field switching, it is possible to sep‐ arately evaluate simultaneous protective fields. Safety laser scanners with vertical (or slightly tilted) protective fields are generally used for this application. The appropriate protective field, from a series of pre‐ programmed protective fields, is activated by corre‐ sponding signals from the machine controller and ade‐ quately positioned sensors. The contour of the protec‐ tive field is designed such that passage of the
material does not cause the protective device to activate, but unmonitored areas are small enough to prevent unde‐ tected entry into the hazardous area by anyone (see figure 61). Alternatively, protective field switching can be per‐ formed independently by the protective device without the need for external sensors or signals (e.g., the Safe Portal system solution from SICK, see figure 58, page 78). Figure 61: Access protection allowing material passage using safety laser scanners, vertical protective fields, and protective field switching with suitably arranged sensors 80 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION Additional functions of ESPE Blanking For many AOPDs, configuration of the detection capabil‐ ity and/or protective field can be designed such that the presence of one or more objects within a defined section of the protective field does not trigger the safety function (OFF state). Blanking can be used to allow specific objects through the protective field, e.g., hose for cooling lubricant, slide/carrier for workpieces (see figure 62). For fixed blanking, the blanked area is precisely defined in terms of its size and position. For floating blanking, only the size of the blanked area is defined, not its position in the protective field (see table 30). If the object for which the blanking function in the pro‐ tective field had been configured, is no longer present in the protective field, there will be a gap in the protec‐ tive field of the AOPD. In this case, the AOPD can trigger Figure 62: Fixed blanking of light curtain beams on a trim‐ the safety function (off state). This prevents undetected ming press approach of parts of the human body to the hazard zone. If the blanked area is not completely covered by the blanked
objects, a gap(s) is created in the protective field. This/these must be closed by additional coverage (see figure 62). Alternatively, the detection capability resulting from the gap must be taken into account in the minimum distance calculation. NOTE In the blanked area, the resolution capability of ESPE is enlarged (deteriorates). Take the corresponding manufac‐ turer's specifications into account when calculating the minimum distance.

This operating mode is advantageous if parts must be manually
loaded and unloaded cyclically. Conforming to the standards, PSDI mode can only be executed with type 4 AOPDs and an effective resolution d ≤ 30 mm. In PSDI mode, the machine waits at a defined position for a specified number of interruptions by the operator. The safety light curtain releases the dangerous movement again automatically after a specific number of interruptions. The ESPE has to be reset under the following conditions: • When the machine starts • On restart when the AOPD is interrupted within a dangerous movement • If no PSDI was triggered within the specified PSDI time It must be checked that no danger to the operator can arise during the work process. This limits the use of this operating mode on machines in which there is no possibility for whole body access and it is not possible for the operator to remain undetected between the protective field and the machine (presence detection). Single break PSDI mode means that the AOPD initiates the machine function after the operator has completed one intervention. Double break PSDI mode means that the AOPD holds the machine function in the locked state after the operator's first intervention (e.g., removal of a machined workpiece). Only after the operator has completed the second intervention (e.g., feeding in of a blank) does the safety light curtain release the machine function again. PSDI mode is often used on presses and stamps, but can also be used on other machines (e.g., rotating tables, automatic assembly systems). When using PSDI mode, it must not be possible to stand behind the light curtain. For presses, special conditions apply for PSDI mode. Figure 63: Single break PSDI mode on an automatic assembly system with safety light curtain. During loading, the tool is at the top point. After the operator leaves
the protective field, the assembly process gets underway. NOTE For PSDI mode, the resolution of the AOPD shall be better than or equivalent to 30 mm (finger or hand detection).

These requirements relate to: • the safety level of the safety-related parts of the control system (SRP/CS) • the avoidance of inadmissible conditions or inad‐ missible reconfigurations • the activation, as well as the conditions for initiat‐ ing the automatic mode of the machine • the state to be adopted when a fault is detected • the necessary conditions for selecting the protec‐ tive field • the installation and the organizational measures When applications with simultaneous field evalua‐ tions are implemented, the number of switchovers is reduced. The design is greatly simplified.

sensor that detects the position of the material that is blocking access to the hazardous area. • Interruption and/or restoration of the power sup‐ ply to the sensors for material detection must not result in the selection of an active protective field that is not suitable for the machine state. • The largest protective field is automatically acti‐ vated immediately after the material passes Figure 66: Schematic representation of protective field through the active protective field. switching using safety light curtains (AOPD) for the passage of materials • The automatic selection of the active protective field must not be triggered by a ground fault or an interruption in the signal lines or power supply to the material detection sensor(s). Figure 67: Schematic representation of protective field switching using vertically mounted safety laser scanners (AOPDDR) for the passage of materials Fixed position protective devices Fixed position protective devices are non-physical guards that ensure a person is located outside the hazardous area, for example buttons, foot switches or two-hand controls. NOTE A comprehensive overview of position fixing protective devices is given in: - Alfred Neudörfer: Konstruieren sicherheitsgerechter Produkte, Springer-Verlag, Berlin u. a., ISBN 978-3-662-62703-7 (8th edition 2020) 84 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION Two-hand control device The hazardous function is only triggered by deliberate actuation of two control switches (e.g., pushbuttons) and ends as soon as one of the control switches is no longer actuated. A two-hand control device can only protect one operator at a time. If several operators operate a machine, a separate two-hand control device must be installed for each operator. There are several types of two-hand control devices. The distinguishing characteristics are listed below. Figure 68: Example use of a two-hand device.
This is designed to be movable (ergonomics). A spacer ring ensures that the safety distance from the hazardous point is main‐ tained. The following basic principles apply to all types: • It shall be ensured that both hands are used. • Releasing one of the two controls stops the dangerous function. • Accidental actuation must be prevented. • It is not possible to simply bypass the two-hand control device. • It must not be possible to take the two-hand control device into the hazardous area. For type II and type III two-hand control devices, the following also apply: • A new function may only be initiated after both controls have been released and then actuated. For type III two-hand control devices, the following also apply: • A function may only be initiated if both controls have been actuated synchronously within 0.5 seconds. Sub-types with detailed control-related requirements are defined for type III two-hand control devices. The most important sub-types are: • Type III A: PLc or SIL 1 • Type III B: PLd or SIL 2 with HFT1 • Type III C: PLe or SIL 3 with HFT1 NOTE HFT1: see "Hardware fault tolerance (HFT)", page 140 NOTE - Requirements on two-hand control devices: ISO 13851 (Type-B standard) NOTICE - Calculation of the minimum distance for two-hand control devices see "Approaches to calculating the minimum distance", page 100 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 85 Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION Enabling devices Enabling devices are control switches which the opera‐ tor can use to purposely enable a machine function. Generally, pushbuttons or foot switches are used as enabling devices. Having proven their worth in indus‐ trial applications, 3-position enabling devices are to be recommended. • Position 1, not actuated Execution
of the function is not enabled • Position 2, actuated in middle position Execution of the function is enabled • Position 3, actuated beyond the middle position Execution of the function is not enabled and it must stop immediately. Depending on the applica‐ tion, the triggering of a safety-related stop func‐ tion or an emergency stop function may also be required. During machine setup and maintenance, and if it is necessary to observe production processes close up, the functions of the protective devices intended for normal operation can be temporarily disabled using Figure 69: Enabling device for setting up an automatic drilling machine enabling devices. This is only permissible, however, in conjunction with other measures that minimize the risk (reduced force or speed, etc.). NOTICE The machine start shall not be initiated solely by the actuation of an enabling device. Instead, movement is only permitted as long as the enabling device is actuated. The enabling device function must not be released while changing back from position 3 to position 2. If enabling devices are equipped with separate contacts in position 3, it is recommended to integrate them into a safety-related stop function or the emergency stop function. Protection against manipulation shall be considered when using enabling devices. NOTE - Requirements on enabling devices: IEC 60204-1 Foot switches Foot switches are used to control work processes. On certain machines (e.g., on presses, punches, bending and sheet metal working machines), foot switches may only be used in safety functions under the following conditions: • only for special operating modes • always in conjunction with other technical protective measures (e.g., slow speed of a dangerous movement) Foot switches used in this way must be designed as follows: • A protective cover to protect against unintentional actuation • A 3-position design similar to the
enabling switch principle (see "Enabling devices", page 86) • With manual reset on actuation of the actuator beyond the pressure point • In such a way that after the dangerous machine function has stopped, the restart occurs only after the foot switch is released and actuated again 86 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION • In such a way that a short circuit in the connection cable between the foot switch and the control system does not trigger an unintentional start (e.g., with at least one normally open contact and one normally closed contact for evaluation) • In appropriate numbers for all operators, so that a dangerous machine function can only be initiated and maintained if all foot switches are actuated Sensors for monitoring machine parameters The risk assessment may show that certain machine parameters shall be monitored and detected during opera‐ tion (see "Monitoring machine parameters", page 47). Safe position monitoring If, for safety reasons, parts of a machine are not allowed to overrun or leave a certain position, position switches or safety-related sensors should be used for this purpose. Electro-sensitive safety inductive position switches are particularly suitable for this task (see table 21, page 63). They monitor a certain part of a robot’s axis or a moving part of a machine for presence without the need for a specific actuator, without wear, and with a high enclosure rating.

NOTE European directives apply to manufacturers and organizations that place machinery on the market in the Euro‐ pean Union. The Machinery Directive Machinery Directive 2006/42/EC addresses the manufacturers and distributors of machines and safety compo‐ nents. It establishes the necessary tasks for new machines to meet health and safety requirements in order to dismantle trade barriers within Europe and to guarantee a high level of health and safety for users and operators. It applies to machines and to safety components individually placed on the markets, as well as to used machines and safety components from third-party countries which are placed on the market in the European Economic Area for the first time (e.g., from the USA or Japan). • In 1989, the Council of the European Community passed the directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to machinery, known as the Machinery Directive (89/392/EEC). • By 1995, this directive had to be applied in all EC Member States. • In 1998, various amendments were summarized and consolidated in the Machinery Directive 98/37/EC. • in 2006, the Machinery Directive 2006/42/EC, which replaced the previous version, was passed.

Safe standstill or rotation evaluation modules monitor the movement of drives using sensors or rotary encod‐ ers to generate a safe control signal at standstill or on deviation from preset parameters. If safety-related requirements are more stringent, either safety encod‐ ers or redundant encoders shall be used. Another possibility is to monitor the voltage induced by residual magnetism on a motor that is spinning down. Figure 71: Speed monitoring for protective field switching on an automated guided vehicle 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 87 Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION Pressure-sensitive protective devices In some applications, pressure sensitive protective devices such as pressure sensitive mats, pressure sensitive rails or bumpers may be useful. The principle of operation is based in the majority of cases on the elastic deformation of a hollow body that ensures an internal signal generation (electromechanical or optical) which triggers the safety function. The standard electromechanical systems are available in various designs. Correct mechanical layout and integration is imperative in all cases for an effective protective function. The detec‐ tion of children with body weights less than 20 kg is not considered in the product standards for pressure-sensitive mats and floors.

A short-circuit between the cables can be prevented by using a special cable layout. NOTE Design of pressure sensitive protective devices: Type-B standard ISO 13856 (series of standards) Complementary protective measures If necessary, provision must be made for further protective measures which are neither inherently safe designs or technical precautionary measures. These might include: • Emergency stop devices • Measures to free and rescue persons who have become trapped • Measures for isolating and dissipating energy (see "Power supply connection", page 31 and see "Mains disconnection device", page 33) • Preventive measures for easy and safe handling of machines and heavy parts • Measures for safe access to machinery 88 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION If these complementary measures are dependent upon the correct function of the corresponding control compo‐ nents, then they are safety functions. The requirements on functional safety must be met for these measures. (see "Application of reset and restart", page 110). Emergency operation To prevent impending hazards to persons, damage to machines or production processes, or to minimize exist‐ ing ones, functions must be provided for such emergen‐ cies. These functions, which cause machine functions to stop (emergency stop) or electrical power to be dis‐ connected (emergency switching off) in an emergency, are complementary protective measures for hazards on machines. They do not replace the use of inherently safer design or protective devices. Figure 72: Emergency stop and reset control switches at a robot station Emergency stop (ISO 13850) In the event of an emergency, not only shall all hazardous machine functions be ceased, but
the energy from all energy sources which pose a hazard shall be dissipated. This procedure is known as emergency stopping. Every machine must be equipped with at least one emergency stop function, except: • Machines for which an emergency stop would not reduce the risk • Hand-held and hand-guided machines The emergency stop function must be triggered by a single action of a person. The following fundamental requirements apply to the emergency stop function and its devices in accordance with ISO 13850: • The actuators of emergency stop control switches must be easily accessible. • The emergency stop function must end the dangerous state in a suitable manner as quickly as possible without creating additional risks. • The emergency stop function must take priority over all other functions and commands in all operating modes. • The emergency stop function must not impair the effectiveness of other safety functions. • Resetting the emergency stop control switches must not initiate a restart. • The principle of direct mechanical positive actuation with mechanical interlocking function must be applied (referred to as a latching function in IEC 60947-5-1). • When an emergency stop control switch is actuated, a stop command must be triggered, regardless of the effectiveness of the mechanical interlock function or latching function. • The emergency stop function must conform to stop category 0 or 1 (see "Stopping", page 35). • The emergency stop function must be designed in such a way that decisions to trigger it do not require the relevant person to think about the consequences (e.g., economic losses). 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 89 Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION Reset If an emergency stop device is actuated, devices triggered by this action must remain in the off state
until the device has been reset. Actuated emergency stop devices must be reset by hand locally. The reset must only prepare the machine to be put back into operation (see "Application of reset and restart", page 110). The operating instructions of the machine must provide information that after actuation and before resetting the control switch, the machine must be checked to determine the reason for the actuation. If the emergency stop control switch is operated by ropes or wires, the instructions must include checking the entire length of the ropes or wires. In the case of emergency stop control switches in porta‐ ble operator panels, resetting the emergency stop com‐ mand must only be possible after the actuated emer‐ gency stop control switch has been unlocked. If the area of operation of the machine is not fully visi‐ ble (see figure 73, page 90), an additional reset must be carried out by one or more reset buttons to avoid the risk of an unexpected start-up. This is to ensure that no persons are present in a danger zone or that persons in need of assistance remain undetected. Figure 73: Example of an area of operation that is not fully visible Emergency stop equipment The emergency stop function is a “safety function” and therefore the requirements of functional safety must be met (ISO 13849-1 or IEC 62061). The required reliability of the safety function (PL or SIL) should correspond to the purpose of the emergency stop function. The minimum requirement, however, is PL c according to ISO 13850 or SIL1 according to IEC 62061. The hydraulic and pneumatic equipment that performs an emergency stop function must comply with the require‐ ments of ISO 4413 or ISO 4414. The electrical equipment for emergency stop functions must meet the requirements of IEC 60204-1.
The contacts on the electrical control switches must be positive opening normally closed contacts. The actuators must be red. The background must be yellow, if present and technically possible. The following types of control device may be used: • Switches actuated with mushroom head pushbuttons • Switches actuated with wires, ropes, or rails • Foot switches without protective cover (only for emergency stop and only if other solutions cannot be used) • Mains disconnecting devices operated by handles according to IEC 60204-1 90 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION Figure 74: Emergency stop control switches in various designs If wires and ropes are used as actuators for emergency stop devices, they must be designed and attached so that they are easy to actuate. Reset devices shall be arranged so that the entire length of the wire or rope is visible from the location of the reset device. Measures must be taken to prevent loss of the emergency stop function due to breakage or unhooking of the wires or ropes. Neither the emergency stop actuator nor the background must be marked with text or symbols. If needed for clarification, only the following symbol (IEC 60417-5638) may be applied: Figure 75: Symbol IEC 60417-5638: Emergency stop To avoid confusion between actuation (e.g., pressing an actuator) and release (e.g., turning an actuator), the marking for release must be the same or approximately the same color as the actuator. Emergency stop control switches must be mounted in such a way that their actuation cannot be prevented by simple means or blocked unintentionally. Actuating surfaces with locks for resetting should be avoided. If such emergency stop control switches are used, the operating instructions for the machine must provide information on
their correct usage. In particular, attention should be drawn to the possibility of injury if actuated with a key inserted. Area of operation of the emergency stop function The area of operation of the emergency stop function must always include the complete machine. If this creates additional hazards or has an unnecessary impact on production, the machine can be divided into several areas of operation of the emergency stop function. Areas of operation may include parts of a machine, a single machine, or a group of machines. Different areas of operation may overlap. A division into areas of operation should take into account the following: a) the visible areas resulting from the machine design b) the ability to recognize dangerous situations (visibility, audibility, etc.) c) all safety-relevant consequences for other parts of the machine or other machines d) the foreseeable hazard exposures e) all possible hazards in the area of operation The different areas of operation must be defined and marked so that the emergency stop control switches can be easily associated with the appropriate areas. The actuation of an emergency stop device for one area of operation must not prevent the triggering of an emergency stop function in another area of operation. The 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 91 Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION operating instructions of the machine must contain information on the area(s) of operation of the emergency stop control switches. Emergency stop control switches with different areas of operation should, as far as technically possible, not be arranged next to each other or located close to each other. Position of emergency stop control switches Emergency stop control switches must be provided at each operator panel unless the risk assessment indi‐ cates that it is not
required. Emergency stop control switches must also be located in other places if the risk assessment indicates this (e.g., at entry and exit points or loading and unloading points). Emergency stop control switches that are to be oper‐ ated by hand must be installed at a height between 0.6 and 1.7 m above the access level (reference level). Foot switches for emergency stop functions must be permanently mounted at the access level. Figure 76: Distributed emergency stop control switches on a packaging system Avoiding unintentional triggering Unintentional triggering of emergency stop control switches must be avoided as far as possible without hindering intentional triggering. This is more likely to be achieved by layout than by design measures: • Locating the emergency stop device away from foreseeably busy areas • Mounting the emergency stop device in a recessed surface of the enclosing operator panel • Selecting a suitable type of emergency stop device • Selecting the appropriate size and shape of the emergency stop device The use of a protective collar around the emergency stop device should be avoided. An exception exists if unintentional actuation must be prevented and other measures are not practicable. Protective collars must not have any sharp corners or edges or rough surfaces and must not hinder or prevent operation with the palm of the hand. This applies from any foreseeable position of the machine operator or other persons who must be able to operate it (nearby operator or work stations). Emergency stop control switches in portable operator panels When emergency stop control switches are installed in portable operator panels, measures must be used to avoid confusion between active and non-active emergency stop control switches. This also applies to operator panels where the emergency stop commands are transmitted via plug connections on the controller. At least one
of the following measures must be used: • Identification of the active emergency stop control switches through a color change by means of illumination • Covering the inactive emergency stop control switches, if possible automatically • Provision of suitable storage for the inactive operator panels Emergency switching off (switching off in an emergency situation - IEC 60204-1) Provision should be made for emergency switching off if there is a possibility of hazards or damage caused by electrical energy. The incoming electrical energy supply should be switched off by electromechanical switching devices. 92 SPECIAL INFORMATION | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK Subject to change without notice 3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION It shall not be possible to switch on the incoming energy supply until all emergency off commands have been reset.

This requires the protective device to be positioned at the required minimum distance from the hazardous point. The necessary minimum distance also depends on the properties of the protective device. This can also affect the selection of the optimal protective device.

The consideration of the minimum safety distance applies to ESPEs with two-dimensional protective fields, e.g., light curtains, single-beam photoelectric safety switches (AOPD), laser scanners (AOPDDR), or two-dimensional camera systems. There are three types of approach. After the stop initiating ESPE has been selected, the required minimum distance between the ESPE’s protective field and the nearest hazardous point is to be calculated. The following parameters shall be taken into account: • Stopping time of the machine • Response time of the safety-related control system • Response time of the protective device (ESPE) • Supplements according to the resolution capability of the ESPE, the protective field height, and/or the type of approach as well as the possibility of bypassing the protective field by reaching around, over or under it (see table 40, page 103). If the minimum distance to the hazardous area is too large and unacceptable from an ergonomic viewpoint, either the overall stopping time of the machine must be reduced or an ESPE with a better detection capability (smaller resolution) chosen. Risks due to a person possibly remaining undetected between the protective field of the ESPE and the hazardous point must be avoided by taking suitable measures against unexpected start-up: • Restart interlocks that require a manual reset • Additional device for detecting persons in the hazardous area (see table 40, page 103) NOTE The calculation of the minimum distance S for
ESPE is described in the ISO 13855 standard (type-B standard). General calculation formula S = (K × T) + C S Minimum distance in millimeters, measured from the nearest hazardous point to the detection zone of the ESPE. K Parameter in millimeters per second, derived from the data for the approach speeds of the body or parts of the body. T Stopping/run-down time for the entire system in seconds.

Protective devices that can be reached over Depending on the height and position of the protective field of an ESPE, the shape of the machine, and other factors, the protective field of an ESPE can be reached over to gain access to hazardous points before the hazardous machine functions have ceased and the intended protection is thereby not provided. The figure shows an example comparing an ESPE that cannot be reached over and an ESPE that can be reached over.
